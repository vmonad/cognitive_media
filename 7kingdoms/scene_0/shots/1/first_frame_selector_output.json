The man's skin appears pale under the reflected glow of hundreds of flickering candles, and the overall image carries a slight, overall tremor due to hand movement. The man's appearance (face, crown, clothing details) should reference Image 0. The setting, lighting, and overall composition (close-up of the crown/face with candle glow in the background) should reference Image 1."
