This scene should reference Image 1. At the absolute front is Queen Sera, heavily armored in polished obsidian, riding powerfully and holding her long sword so it arcs silver. Queen Sera's appearance and armor should reference Image 0, while her posture and the action of riding powerfully should reference the central figure in Image 1."
