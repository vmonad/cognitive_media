The area where the warrior was standing is now just the backdrop of the now-closed fissure. The light is intensely green at the center, where the gate has snapped shut. The overall scene and lighting should essentially be the setting from Image 0, but with The Wolf character removed, leaving only the dark, craggy background and the intensely green, swirling, and now-closed Shadow Gate at the center."
