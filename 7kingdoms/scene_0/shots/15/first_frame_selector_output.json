The warrior is positioned center frame, looking directly toward the supernatural phenomenon. The background environment should reference Image 3, including the rocky surroundings and the swirling green light from the fissure. The Wolf's appearance, including his armor, bloodstains, and ferocious expression, should primarily reference Image 0, but his stance and position should match the composition of the warrior in Image 3."
