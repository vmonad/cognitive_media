The scene should be an exterior shot of ruins on a chaotic battlefield filled with the surging tide of the Skeletal Legion (The Risen Dead), referencing Image 2 for the background and overall composition. Queen Sera, armored in polished obsidian, should stand on the left side of the foreground, referencing Image 0 for her appearance. The Wolf, a savage-looking warrior with a scarred face, should stand on the right side of the foreground, referencing Image 1 for his appearance. Queen Sera and The Wolf are locked in an intense eye contact across the melee. The visual style from Image 2 should be maintained."
