A wide, low-angle shot focused on the ground where a colossal FISSURE, the Shadow Gate, is shown swirling with sickly green light. A massive wave of skeletal warriors, composed of bone and rusty metal, is actively pouring forth from the gate, many holding rusty weapons. This scene should heavily reference Image 1 (for the overall environment, composition, lighting, and atmosphere). The skeletal warriors should reference Image 0 for their appearance (bone structure, rusty metal armor, glowing red eyes, and general menacing look). In the foreground, figures representing the living armies recoil in unified horror."
