The figure standing in the foreground should be Prince Kael, positioned similarly to the figure in Image 2. Prince Kael's appearance (armor, cape, general features) should reference Image 0 for the front-facing/detailed look and Image 1 for the side profile, as required by the intended posture of cold calculation. The background should feature large siege weapons launching projectiles marked by trapped blue energy impacting stone fortifications, as generally depicted in Image 2. The overall atmosphere should be tactical, consistent with Image 2."
