            "A photorealistic dark fairy tale, Hollywood blockbuster production quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, low angle medium close-up on the entryway of an interior space. The heavy oak front door is violently splintered inward, framing a torrent of bright, rain-soaked exterior light and atmosphere behind a massive silhouette. The silhouette belongs to a broad-shouldered figure whose axe is raised high over their shoulder. This figure wears a dark, dripping plaid shirt. Practical lighting striking the scene emphasizes water running down their thick, dark beard. The figure's expression is etched with fierce, protective purpose."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description, adhering to the visual style: Photorealistic dark fairy tale, Hollywood blockbuster production quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, rich cinematic color grade with desaturated earth tones and one vivid accent color (Red's crimson cloak), volumetric god rays in forest scenes, warm candlelight interiors with deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture, practical lighting sources (oil lamps, fireplace, lanterns), every surface tactile and weathered (moss, bark, iron, lace, wet stone, velvet), atmospheric fog and rain. \n\nA photorealistic dark fairy tale, low angle close-up on the face of a broad-shouldered man. The man's appearance MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing (including the red cloth over the shoulder which should be visible) from Image 1. The man's expression is etched with fierce, protective purpose, similar to the expression in Image 2. The man's axe is held ready, positioned just off-frame or slightly lower than in Image 2. The rain and exterior light still backlight the scene, creating a strong silhouette effect similar to Image 2, but volumetric light highlights the water droplets clinging to the individual hairs of his thick, dark beard, referencing the detail in Image 1 and the wetness in Image 2. His earnest face should be slightly clearer against the bright background, seen in shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh rendering the background light sources, matching the depth of field/bokeh style described in the visual style directive and present in Image 2. The lighting on the character must match the strong backlight/rim lighting from the exterior, as seen in Image 2. The character must be proportionally placed and look physically embedded in the space of pouring rain and dark atmosphere."
