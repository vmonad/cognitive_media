            "Reference establishing shot of location 'cottage_interior_granny_room': The interior of the cottage at night, lit primarily by the low, dying orange embers in the fireplace. Granny sits in a heavy, dark wood rocking chair, which is slowly moving. In the shadows, a dark wood table is visible where a heavy leather book rests. The mood is claustrophobic, dominated by the dying firelight and deep shadows. A large grandfather clock is present, likely standing sentinel."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: \nA photorealistic dark fairy tale CLOSE-UP in an atmospheric foyer area illuminated by warm, practical sidelighting that casts deep chiaroscuro shadows. The focus is tight on the upper body of the individual wearing the deep blood-crimson velvet hooded cloak, which is currently down, revealing beautiful dark hair cascading freely over the shoulders. The face is relaxed, conveying genuine relief. The eyes are focused slightly off-camera toward a heavy iron door handle located just outside the frame to the right. The textural quality of the velvet cloak is highly tactile, catching highlights from the warm, low-key illumination. \n\nRed's identity MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 0. The cloak's texture, color (deep blood-crimson velvet), and way it drapes should reference Image 0. \n\nThe lighting, atmosphere, and dark, weathered interior feel should reference the warm, low-key illumination and dark/shadows present in Image 2, particularly the chiaroscuro effect. \n\nCharacters must be placed at correct proportional scale within the environment. Lighting on the character must match the environment's warm, practical sidelighting. The character must look physically embedded in the space, not composited on top. \n\nVisual Style: Photorealistic dark fairy tale, Hollywood blockbuster production quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, rich cinematic color grade with desaturated earth tones and one vivid accent color (Red's crimson cloak), volumetric god rays in forest scenes, warm candlelight interiors with deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture, practical lighting sources (oil lamps, fireplace, lanterns), every surface tactile and weathered (moss, bark, iron, lace, wet stone, velvet), atmospheric fog and rain. NOT cartoon, NOT anime, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT digital art, NOT 3D render, NOT watercolor, NOT painting."
