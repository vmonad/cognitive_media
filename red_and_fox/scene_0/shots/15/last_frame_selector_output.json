            "A photorealistic dark fairy tale establishing shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, taken from a very LOW ANGLE across a muddy path, looking up toward a cottage exterior in a sudden, heavy downpour. The camera frames the splintered, partially open front door near the bottom left, with the cottage's stone walls rising dramatically, heavily detailed with moss and water runoff. Rain hammers the thatched roof in dense, streaking sheets, creating a highly tactile texture emphasized by the photorealism. A brilliant flash of LIGHTNING momentarily illuminates the wet stone walls and the sodden, dead garden, casting sharp, momentary highlights on the weathered stone surfaces. No characters are visible. Ambient sound of torrential rain and wind. No score."

            "Reference establishing shot of location 'cottage_exterior_rain_storm': The cottage exterior during a violent, heavy downpour at night. Rain hammers the thatched roof in continuous sheets, causing the surrounding path to turn to mud. A flash of lightning briefly scrapes stark light across the wet, dark stonework walls and enhances the appearance of the sodden, dead garden. The atmosphere is chaotic, loud, and metaphoric of severe consequence."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description, maintaining the visual style: Photorealistic dark fairy tale, Hollywood blockbuster production quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, rich cinematic color grade with desaturated earth tones and one vivid accent color (Red's crimson cloak), volumetric god rays in forest scenes, warm candlelight interiors with deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture, practical lighting sources (oil lamps, fireplace, lanterns), every surface tactile and weathered (moss, bark, iron, lace, wet stone, velvet), atmospheric fog and rain. The image should be a photorealistic dark fairy tale establishing shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, taken from a very LOW ANGLE across a muddy path, looking up towards the distant, dark, blurred treeline, which is the main background element. The thatched cottage and the partially open front doorway should be visible to the left, but heavily blurred due to shallow depth of field/motion. Rain must continue in thick, streaking sheets, adhering to the visual style of violent water, drawing reference from the rain/texture in Image 1. The overall lighting and atmosphere should reference the moody, dark, wet exterior of Image 0 and Image 1, with the heavy rain and mud texture strongly suggested by Image 0 and Image 1. The cottage elements and their warmth should hint at Image 5 for the setting, but heavily blurred."
