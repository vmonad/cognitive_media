    "visual_desc": "ESTABLISHING SHOT (SCENE 4). The cottage exterior in a sudden, heavy downpour, seen from a very LOW ANGLE across the now-muddy path. Rain hammers the thatched roof in dense, streaking sheets. A brilliant flash of LIGHTNING briefly illuminates the stone walls and the sodden, dead garden, highlighting the texture of the weathered stone. The camera executes a slow PAN from the splintered, partially open front door across the storm-lashed facade to the dark, blurred treeline. No characters visible. Emotion: the storm as metaphor for consequence. Photorealism emphasizes the violence of the water.",
    "variation_type": "large",
    "variation_reason": "This is an establishing shot that transitions from focusing on a specific architectural element (the door/facade) to a distant environmental element (the treeline) via a significant camera movement (slow pan across the entire length of the structure), leading to a large shift in the compositional focus and background detail.",
    "ff_desc": "A photorealistic dark fairy tale establishing shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, taken from a very LOW ANGLE across a muddy path, looking up toward a cottage exterior in a sudden, heavy downpour. The camera frames the splintered, partially open front door near the bottom left, with the cottage's stone walls rising dramatically, heavily detailed with moss and water runoff. Rain hammers the thatched roof in dense, streaking sheets, creating a highly tactile texture emphasized by the photorealism. A brilliant flash of LIGHTNING momentarily illuminates the wet stone walls and the sodden, dead garden, casting sharp, momentary highlights on the weathered stone surfaces. No characters are visible. Ambient sound of torrential rain and wind. No score.",

    "lf_desc": "A photorealistic dark fairy tale establishing shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, taken from a very LOW ANGLE across the muddy path. The frame is now focused on the dark, blurred treeline in the distance, which has replaced the cottage facade as the main background element. The thatched cottage and the open doorway are visible to the left, but are now heavily blurred due to the camera movement. Rain continues in thick, streaking sheets, adhering to the visual style of violent water. Ambient sound of heavy rain and wind. No score.",
    "lf_vis_char_idxs": [],
    "motion_desc": "The shot begins with the camera fixed on the open doorway and the lower part of the facade. A slow PAN executes from the splintered, partially open front door across the storm-lashed facade. During the pan, a brilliant flash of LIGHTNING occurs, momentarily intensifying the light on the stone walls. The pan concludes as it settles on the dark, blurred treeline beyond the cottage grounds. The motion is slow and smooth, evoking the metaphor of consequence inherent in the violent storm. The heavy rain creates streaks across the lens elements, maintaining the violent water atmosphere, while the anamorphic bokeh blurs the background textures as the camera moves toward the treeline. Ambient sound of torrential rain and wind continues.",
    "audio_desc": "[Sound Effect] RAIN ROARING in sheets; distant, muffled THUNDER; high wind buffeting the structure. [Music Score] Deep, continuous OMINOUS RUMBLE swells, drowning out most other sound."
