            "A photorealistic dark fairy tale medium shot inside a dimly lit Victorian cottage. On the right side of the frame stands a devastatingly handsome man with sharp angular wolfish features, amber-golden eyes, reddish-brown tousled hair, wearing a long dark charcoal coat with auburn fox fur collar and black leather gloves — The Fox. He faces slightly left toward the center. In the center of the frame, an elderly woman with silver-white hair in a tight bun sits motionless and lifeless in a wooden rocking chair, her eyes closed, head slightly bowed. She wears a high-collared black Victorian dress. The rocking chair is still. Behind them, a grandfather clock and dying fireplace embers cast warm candlelight with deep chiaroscuro shadows. The Fox's amber eyes gleam in the firelight. Shallow depth of field with anamorphic bokeh. 35mm film grain."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic dark fairy tale medium shot inside the same dimly lit Victorian cottage as Image 2. On the left side of the frame stands a breathtakingly beautiful brunette woman with long dark wavy chestnut-brown hair, luminous porcelain skin, and striking green-hazel eyes, wearing a deep blood-crimson velvet hooded cloak over a dark charcoal dress — Red. Red's appearance and clothing must exactly replicate the facial features, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from a hypothetical Red portrait reference (since no dedicated portrait is available, use the best available full-body reference to inform appearance). On the right stands The Fox, whose appearance MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 0, and his pose and dark charcoal coat with fox fur collar must reference his placement and attire in Image 2. Between them, the elderly woman in black Victorian dress sits lifeless in the rocking chair; the woman's appearance must MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 1. The scene should maintain the dark ambiance, grandfather clock, and background elements from Image 2.\n\nRed and The Fox lock eyes across the dim room over Granny's still body — a single conspiratorial glance confirming their pact. The lighting must match the style of Image 2: warm candlelight with deep chiaroscuro shadows, casting volumetric light effects where appropriate within the interior. The overall style MUST adhere strictly to the mandatory directive: Photorealistic dark fairy tale, Hollywood blockbuster production quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, rich cinematic color grade with desaturated earth tones and the vivid accent color of Red's crimson cloak, warm candlelight interiors with deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture, every surface tactile and weathered, atmospheric fog and rain implied.\n\nProportion and Lighting: Red, The Fox, and the rocking chair must be placed at correct proportional scale within the environment, physically embedded in the space. Lighting on all characters must match the environment's warm candlelight sources, creating deep shadows consistent with Image 2."
