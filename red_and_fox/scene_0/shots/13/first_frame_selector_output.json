            "Reference establishing shot of location 'cottage_exterior_dusk': An isolated, menacing cottage viewed during the golden hour as dusk settles. The structure features ivy-covered stone walls and a crooked chimney trailing thin, pale smoke. The architecture appears old and neglected. Dead roses cling to the overgrown garden surrounding the house. A single, dim, warm-toned lantern casts a small pool of light near the heavy oak front door. The atmosphere is one of lonely menace under a darkening sky."

            "Reference establishing shot of location 'cottage_interior_granny_room': The interior of the cottage at night, lit primarily by the low, dying orange embers in the fireplace. Granny sits in a heavy, dark wood rocking chair, which is slowly moving. In the shadows, a dark wood table is visible where a heavy leather book rests. The mood is claustrophobic, dominated by the dying firelight and deep shadows. A large grandfather clock is present, likely standing sentinel."

    "text_prompt": "Create a photorealistic dark fairy tale, Hollywood blockbuster production quality close-up shot focused tightly on a heavy oak interior door. The lighting should be dim, referencing the weak exterior lantern light seen in Image 1, casting subtle illumination across the dark wood texture of the door. The door's appearance, texture, and dark tone should reference the door visible in Image 1, although shown closer and without the exterior context. The dark, moody, and tactile aesthetic, including deep chiaroscuro shadows and film grain, must adhere to the overall style of Image 1 and Image 3. Ensure the lighting on the door surface matches the warm, low intensity practical light source suggested by the exterior lantern in Image 1, leading to deep shadows characteristic of Image 3. Shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh is required."
