Granny sits in a heavy, dark wood rocking chair, which is slowly moving. In the shadows, a dark wood table is visible where a heavy leather book rests. The mood is claustrophobic, dominated by the dying firelight and deep shadows. A large grandfather clock is present, likely standing sentinel."

    "text_prompt": "Create a photorealistic dark fairy tale two-shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, depicting the interior of a ruined dwelling. The scene must be dimly lit by practical warm candlelight casting deep chiaroscuro shadows against weathered wooden walls, referencing the lighting and environment of Image 2. \n\n<Red> stands observing in the foreground. <Red>'s appearance (face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing) MUST exactly replicate Image 0. <Red> is wearing a deep blood-crimson velvet hooded cloak, similar to Image 0, and holds an iron locket around her neck. <Red>'s posture must be still, and her expression masked.\n\n<The Woodsman> stands immediately beside <Red>, his appearance (face, hair, beard, build, and clothing) MUST exactly replicate Image 1. <The Woodsman>'s expression must be one of honest, open, solemn concern, referencing the emotional context of Image 2. His expression must be set in solemn concern, and his large calloused hands must gently support a heavy shape entirely wrapped in a dark blanket, similar to the action in Image 2.\n\nCharacters must be correctly scaled proportionally to the environment based on Image 2. Lighting on characters must match the warm candlelight source described in Image 2, creating deep chiaroscuro shadows characteristic of the visual style. The final image must have rich cinematic color grade with desaturated earth tones and the vivid accent color of Red's crimson cloak, 35mm film grain texture, and shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh. The ambient sound suggested by the scene is the patter of heavy rain against the structure."
