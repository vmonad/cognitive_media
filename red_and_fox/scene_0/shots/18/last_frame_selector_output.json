            "Reference establishing shot of location 'cottage_exterior_rain_storm': The cottage exterior during a violent, heavy downpour at night. Rain hammers the thatched roof in continuous sheets, causing the surrounding path to turn to mud. A flash of lightning briefly scrapes stark light across the wet, dark stonework walls and enhances the appearance of the sodden, dead garden. The atmosphere is chaotic, loud, and metaphoric of severe consequence."

            "A photorealistic dark fairy tale two-shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, depicting the interior of a ruined dwelling, dimly lit by practical warm candlelight casting deep chiaroscuro shadows against weathered wooden walls. The brunette with long dark wavy chestnut-brown hair, wearing a deep blood-crimson velvet hooded cloak, stands observing in the foreground, her posture still and her expression masked as she holds an iron locket around her neck. The broad-shouldered woodsman with a thick dark beard streaked with grey stands immediately beside her, his honest, open expression set in solemn concern, his large calloused hands gently supporting a heavy shape entirely wrapped in a dark blanket. The ambient sound is dominated by the patter of heavy rain against the structure, suggesting a continuous deluge outside. The score is a low, sustained cello drone."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image based on the following description, adhering strictly to the visual style: Photorealistic dark fairy tale, Hollywood blockbuster production quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, rich cinematic color grade with desaturated earth tones and one vivid accent color (Red's crimson cloak), volumetric god rays in forest scenes, warm candlelight interiors with deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture, practical lighting sources (oil lamps, fireplace, lanterns), every surface tactile and weathered (moss, bark, iron, lace, wet stone, velvet), atmospheric fog and rain. \n\nA photorealistic dark fairy tale close-up to medium-wide shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, focusing near the ruined front doorway. The wooden door frame is prominently featured, showing rain-slicked darkness beyond. The broad-shouldered woodsman with a thick dark beard streaked with grey should MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 1 (the woodsman). His body is half-obscured by the frame as he pushes his bulk through the doorway, heading outward, torso up, shoulders braced, mirroring his posture in Image 1 but turned to exit. He has just turned away from the interior. The brunette in the deep blood-crimson velvet hooded cloak should MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 1 (the brunette). She is visible just inside the doorway, out of focus in the background, facing the woodsman's departure. The door frame and the exterior rain-slicked darkness should reference the dark, wet atmosphere and dramatic lighting suggested by Image 0. The volumetric light from inside (warm candlelight) should struggle to pierce the sheeting rain outside, which is highlighted by the external darkness. The sound of heavy rain is now louder and more present. Ensure characters are placed at the correct proportional scale relative to the doorway and environment. Lighting on characters must match the dim interior light struggling against the intense, dark exterior weather, casting deep chiaroscuro shadows."
