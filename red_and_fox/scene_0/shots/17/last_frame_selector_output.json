            "Reference establishing shot of location 'cottage_interior_granny_room': The interior of the cottage at night, lit primarily by the low, dying orange embers in the fireplace. Granny sits in a heavy, dark wood rocking chair, which is slowly moving. In the shadows, a dark wood table is visible where a heavy leather book rests. The mood is claustrophobic, dominated by the dying firelight and deep shadows. A large grandfather clock is present, likely standing sentinel."

            "A photorealistic dark fairy tale medium shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, of a lavishly appointed but shadowed room. Dominating the center-right is a dark wooden rocking chair, upon which rests a shrouded, body-sized bundle. To the left, deep in the frame and partially obscured by shadows and shallow depth of field, a figure wearing a deep blood-crimson velvet hooded cloak and dark charcoal dress is seen lunging forward, their body suspended mid-air just before impact with the chair. The visible porcelain skin of the attacker's face shows signs of strained intensity. The background is out of focus, showing the suggestion of a large, broken window structure through creamy bokeh. The scene is lit with warm, low-key interior light, emphasizing the deep chiaroscuro shadows, and the texture of the wet velvet cloak is visible even in this initial state."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic dark fairy tale medium shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, at eye level. The central figure wearing the deep blood-crimson velvet hooded cloak should directly reference the figure in Image 1, adopting the 'lunging forward' posture but now collapsed over the shrouded bundle on the rocking chair. The cloak should appear saturated and clinging to the slender frame, matching the texture and color of the cloak in Image 1. The figure's face should show an expression of ragged despair, with porcelain skin appearing glistening from rain or tears, referencing the facial appearance in Image 1. The figure's right hand, adorned with a lace-cuffed sleeve, is raised and trembling, pointing toward the deep background. The shrouded bundle on the rocking chair should resemble the bundle in Image 1. The rocking chair and environmental elements (shadows, lighting) should strongly reference the composition, lighting, and atmosphere of Image 1, maintaining the deep chiaroscuro shadows and low-key interior light. The background should remain softly out of focus, focused on the suggestion of a broken window structure with creamy anamorphic bokeh, as seen in Image 1. The overall scene must adhere to the visual style directive: Photorealistic dark fairy tale, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, warm candlelight interiors with deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. The environmental lighting on the character must match the deep chiaroscuro shadows prevalent in Image 1 and the interior lighting established in Image 0 (dying firelight ambience)."
