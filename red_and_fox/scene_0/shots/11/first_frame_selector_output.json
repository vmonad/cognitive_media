            "Reference establishing shot of location 'cottage_interior_granny_room': The interior of the cottage at night, lit primarily by the low, dying orange embers in the fireplace. Granny sits in a heavy, dark wood rocking chair, which is slowly moving. In the shadows, a dark wood table is visible where a heavy leather book rests. The mood is claustrophobic, dominated by the dying firelight and deep shadows. A large grandfather clock is present, likely standing sentinel."

    "text_prompt": "Create a photorealistic dark fairy tale medium shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with anamorphic lenses, inside a dimly lit room, focusing on the area near a fireplace. The scene should match the interior styling and lighting of Image 0 and Image 1. Granny, with a gaunt build, silver-white hair in a severe tight bun, and wearing a high-collared black Victorian dress with a cameo brooch, should be seated upright in a rocking chair, her posture rigid, referencing the positioning of the chair and occupant in Image 2. The rocking chair must be positioned near the hearth where dying embers cast a low, flickering orange light against deep shadows, similar to Image 0. The light source must emphasize the texture of the weathered stone hearth, consistent with Image 0. The overall atmosphere should have deep chiaroscuro shadows and a creamy anamorphic bokeh, adhering to the visual style. Ambient sound is dominated by the slow, monotonous CREAK of the chair. Granny's appearance should be consistent with the general character depiction suggested by the context of the prior images, focusing on the old woman in the chair. The lighting on Granny must match the low, flickering orange light from the dying embers near the fireplace."
