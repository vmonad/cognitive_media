            "Reference establishing shot of location 'dark_forest_path': A dense, ancient forest canopy seen at dusk. The lighting is low, moody, and dominated by deep shadows. Patches of thick, low-hanging fog drift through the trees, pierced occasionally by faint, ethereal god rays filtering down from above. The forest floor is dark, cluttered with moss and decaying organic matter, revealing a narrow, dirt path that vanishes into oppressive shadows. Atmospheric quality is intensely dense and oppressive."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic dark fairy tale MEDIUM WIDE SHOT, focused toward the forest floor. The camera is positioned low, capturing the immediate foreground dominated by rough, dark roots, dark green moss clinging to the earth, and scattered detritus. A narrow, muddy path stretches away from the camera, vanishing into the deep, shadowed recesses of the forest further back. \n\nThe environment (forest floor, roots, moss, path, atmosphere, and lighting) should heavily reference Image 0. The lighting must be low and diffused, typical of dusk in a dense forest with mist, creating deep shadows between the roots, blending the style directed by the VISUAL_STYLE. Photorealistic dark fairy tale, Hollywood blockbuster production quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, rich cinematic color grade with desaturated earth tones and one vivid accent color (Red's crimson cloak), volumetric god rays in forest scenes, warm candlelight interiors with deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture, practical lighting sources (oil lamps, fireplace, lanterns), every surface tactile and weathered (moss, bark, iron, lace, wet stone, velvet), atmospheric fog and rain.
