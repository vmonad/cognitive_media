    "visual_desc": "ESTABLISHING SHOT (SCENE 3). Night. The cottage exterior viewed from behind. Faint firelight glows weakly through the small, unlatched back window. The camera starts WIDE from the dark tree line, then executes a slow DOLLY FORWARD through the overgrown back garden toward the window. Fog drifts across the stone foundation, obscuring the base of the walls. The chimney smoke is a phantom plume against the ink-black sky. No characters. Emotion: approaching danger. Practical cottage light sources contrast deeply with the natural darkness.",
    "variation_type": "large",
    "variation_reason": "This is an establishing shot that performs a significant camera movement (a slow dolly forward from the tree line to the cottage exterior) that dramatically shifts the composition, scale, and proximity to the focal element (the window), thus changing the visual focus entirely from the general environment to the specific structure.",
    "ff_desc": "A photorealistic dark fairy tale establishing wide shot taken from the dark tree line at night. The composition is dominated by the silhouette of dense, overgrown foliage in the foreground and the distant, small, isolated cottage structure. Faint, weak, warm firelight emanates only from the small, unlatched back window of the cottage, creating a focal point against the ink-black sky. The ground between the camera and the cottage is characterized by overgrown garden elements and dark, damp earth. Volumetric fog, illuminated faintly near the ground, drifts low across the stone foundation of the cottage. The chimney stack is visible, from which a subtle plume of smoke curls upward, almost invisible against the harsh darkness. No characters are visible at this distance, only architectural and environmental elements. The overall mood is one of profound isolation and impending danger, heightened by deep chiaroscuro shadows and the texture of 35mm film grain.",
    "ff_vis_char_idxs": [],
    "lf_desc": "A photorealistic dark fairy tale medium close-up focused sharply on the small, unlatched back window of the cottage. The exterior aspect remains the same, but the background is tighter, emphasizing the cottage wall and the surrounding dark, mossy stones. Faint, warm firelight spills visibly outward from the opening, casting soft, localized shadows onto the immediate exterior wall structure. The trailing phantom plume of chimney smoke is still faintly visible against the velvet black sky above the roofline. No characters are visible inside or directly outside the frame, which is focused solely on the point of entry/emanation of light. Shallow depth of field creates creamy anamorphic bokeh on the closest fog tendrils.",
    "lf_vis_char_idxs": [],
    "motion_desc": "The shot begins static from the dark tree line. A slow DOLLY FORWARD camera movement commences, pushing deliberately and steadily through the foreground towards the cottage's back wall. This movement is motivated by approaching danger, taking the viewer from the perceived safety of the woods into the immediate vicinity of the structure. As the camera moves, low-lying volumetric fog drifts across the stone foundation, partially obscuring the base of the cottage walls. The only other motion is the slow, ethereal upward drift of the chimney smoke against the night sky. The movement ends when the camera settles into a medium close-up framing the back window, revealing the structure as the primary visual subject.",
    "audio_desc": "[Sound Effect] Distant CRICKETS; a single, lonely OWL HOOT; the FAINT, rhythmic CREAK of the rocking chair from inside the cottage. [Music Score] Barely audible, high-tension STRINGS begin to weave underneath the ambient sound."
