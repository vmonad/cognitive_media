The light throws strong, dancing shadows, particularly the massive, severe shadow of an unseen figure (Granny) engulfing the foreground. The floor appears to be cold, dark stone. The atmosphere is charged with internalized fear and tension."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description with a Photorealistic dark fairy tale style, Hollywood blockbuster production quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, rich cinematic color grade with desaturated earth tones and one vivid accent color (Red's crimson cloak), volumetric god rays in forest scenes, warm candlelight interiors with deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture, practical lighting sources (oil lamps, fireplace, lanterns), every surface tactile and weathered (moss, bark, iron, wet stone, velvet), atmospheric fog and rain. \n\nA photorealistic dark fairy tale CLOSE-UP flashback showcasing Young Red (aged eight), who has beautiful brunette wavy hair and porcelain skin, sitting rigid on a cold stone floor. The character Young Red MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing (if visible/applicable) from Image 1 for facial features, expression, and posture reference, and be scaled appropriately for a close-up on a stone floor. \n\nHer small, focused face is intensely illuminated by the flickering, practical orange GLOW of a fireplace, creating deep chiaroscuro shadows across her features. The lighting on Young Red MUST match the flickering orange firelight and deep chiaroscuro shadows of the environment described in Image 0. The tension in her jaw is visible, and her hands are tightly clenched in her lap. \n\nGranny's massive, severe shadow MUST dominate the background, completely engulfing the area behind the child, matching the shadow detail and scale reference from Image 0. The environment (stone floor, fireplace glow) MUST look like the interior shown in Image 0, maintaining the same proportional scale between the child and the environment (Stone floor and Granny's shadow). The lighting emphasizes the 35mm film grain texture due to its low intensity. The ambiance suggests oppressive silence, underscored only by the crackle of embers."
