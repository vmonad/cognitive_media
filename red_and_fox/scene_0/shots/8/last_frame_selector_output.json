            "Reference establishing shot of location 'dark_forest_path': A dense, ancient forest canopy seen at dusk. The lighting is low, moody, and dominated by deep shadows. Patches of thick, low-hanging fog drift through the trees, pierced occasionally by faint, ethereal god rays filtering down from above. The forest floor is dark, cluttered with moss and decaying organic matter, revealing a narrow, dirt path that vanishes into oppressive shadows. Atmospheric quality is intensely dense and oppressive."

            "A photorealistic dark fairy tale close-up, shot with an anamorphic lens creating extreme shallow depth of field, focusing tightly on a pair of striking green-hazel eyes belonging to an adult. The eyes show a terrible, steely hardness, tracking sharply forward, looking directly toward or past the camera lens. The lighting casts subtle, warm highlights across the porcelain skin surrounding the eyes, contrasting against the texture of the dark brunette, wavy chestnut-brown hair framing the face. Ambient sound is silent; the score is absent."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description, maintaining the visual style of Photorealistic dark fairy tale, Hollywood blockbuster production quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, rich cinematic color grade with desaturated earth tones and one vivid accent color (Red's crimson cloak), volumetric god rays in forest scenes, warm candlelight interiors with deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture, practical lighting sources (oil lamps, fireplace, lanterns), every surface tactile and weathered (moss, bark, iron, lace, wet stone, velvet), atmospheric fog and rain. \n\nThe image should be a photorealistic dark fairy tale medium-low angle tracking shot capturing an adult individual, Red, moving along a dark forest path. \n\nThe environment, lighting, and atmosphere MUST reference Image 3. Specifically, use the dense, dark forest path setting at dusk with low, moody lighting, thick fog, and volumetric god rays filtering through the canopy as seen in Image 3. The lighting on the character must match the dappled sunlight filtering through the high forest canopy creating pronounced volumetric god rays, highlighting the texture of the cloak, and casting deep shadows consistent with Image 3's atmosphere.\n\nThe individual, Red, MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 1. Red should wear the deep blood-crimson velvet hooded cloak pulled low over their beautiful, long dark wavy chestnut-brown hair, as seen in Image 1. Red's expression must show absolute, focused intent. The camera angle should be a medium-low angle tracking shot following Red along the path.\n\nInclude a wicker basket swinging rhythmically by their side. The surrounding environment must resolve into creamy, out-of-focus bokeh due to the shallow depth of field, as implied by the shallow depth of field reference in Image 4, which depicts the forest floor structure.\n\nThe character must be placed at the correct proportional scale within the environment. The lighting on Red must match the environment's light sources (direction, color temperature, intensity). Red must look physically embedded in the space, not composited on top."
