            "Reference establishing shot of location 'dark_forest_path': A dense, ancient forest canopy seen at dusk. The lighting is low, moody, and dominated by deep shadows. Patches of thick, low-hanging fog drift through the trees, pierced occasionally by faint, ethereal god rays filtering down from above. The forest floor is dark, cluttered with moss and decaying organic matter, revealing a narrow, dirt path that vanishes into oppressive shadows. Atmospheric quality is intensely dense and oppressive."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic dark fairy tale Wide Shot establishes the scene on a narrow, uneven dirt path beneath the towering silhouettes of massive oaks. Diffused, oppressive ambient light permeates the deep forest, emphasizing the gloom, though some faint, volumetric god rays struggle through the canopy. This environment must reference Image 0.\nIn the center-left, the figure of Red stands alone, facing slightly away from the camera toward the receding dense fog, her posture rigid. Red MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 1. The character must be recognizably identical to the portrait reference. Her crimson velvet hooded cloak should be clearly visible, contrasting with the dark forest. Her fingers are currently visible against the hood's rich texture.\nThe environment is dominated by dark, moss-covered tree trunks, conveying tangible, weathered stone and bark texture, matching the atmosphere and texture of Image 0. Anamorphic bokeh is soft but visible in the obscured background. The overall visual style must adhere to: Photorealistic dark fairy tale, Hollywood blockbuster production quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, rich cinematic color grade with desaturated earth tones and one vivid accent color (Red's crimson cloak), volumetric god rays in forest scenes, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture, practical lighting sources (oil lamps, fireplace, lanterns), every surface tactile and weathered (moss, bark, iron, lace, wet stone, velvet), atmospheric fog and rain."
