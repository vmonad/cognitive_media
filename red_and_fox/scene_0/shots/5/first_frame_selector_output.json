            "Reference establishing shot of location 'cottage_exterior_dusk': An isolated, menacing cottage viewed during the golden hour as dusk settles. The structure features ivy-covered stone walls and a crooked chimney trailing thin, pale smoke. The architecture appears old and neglected. Dead roses cling to the overgrown garden surrounding the house. A single, dim, warm-toned lantern casts a small pool of light near the heavy oak front door. The atmosphere is one of lonely menace under a darkening sky."

            "Reference establishing shot of location 'dark_forest_path': A dense, ancient forest canopy seen at dusk. The lighting is low, moody, and dominated by deep shadows. Patches of thick, low-hanging fog drift through the trees, pierced occasionally by faint, ethereal god rays filtering down from above. The forest floor is dark, cluttered with moss and decaying organic matter, revealing a narrow, dirt path that vanishes into oppressive shadows. Atmospheric quality is intensely dense and oppressive."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: \nA photorealistic dark fairy tale establishing shot, rendered with rich cinematic color grading, taken from the edge of a dark forest treeline. The composition is wide, focusing on an isolated, weathered stone cottage bathed in the warm, oblique light of the golden hour, which should reference Image 1. The crooked chimney faintly trails a thin plume of grey smoke against the darkening sky, referencing Image 1. No figures are present. The immediate foreground is dominated by the texture of dark, dense forest foliage, which should reference Image 0. The overall mood is tactile and lonely. The lighting on the cottage must match the warm, oblique, golden hour light with a darkening sky as seen in Image 1. The style must adhere strictly to the visual style: Photorealistic dark fairy tale, Hollywood blockbuster production quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, rich cinematic color grade with desaturated earth tones and one vivid accent color (Red's crimson cloak), volumetric god rays in forest scenes, warm candlelight interiors with deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture, practical lighting sources (oil lamps, fireplace, lanterns), every surface tactile and weathered (moss, bark, iron, lace, wet stone, velvet), atmospheric fog and rain. NOT cartoon, NOT anime, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT digital art, NOT 3D render, NOT watercolor, NOT painting."
