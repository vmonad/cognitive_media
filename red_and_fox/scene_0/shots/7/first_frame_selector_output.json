            "Reference establishing shot of location 'cottage_interior_granny_room': The interior of the cottage at night, lit primarily by the low, dying orange embers in the fireplace. Granny sits in a heavy, dark wood rocking chair, which is slowly moving. In the shadows, a dark wood table is visible where a heavy leather book rests. The mood is claustrophobic, dominated by the dying firelight and deep shadows. A large grandfather clock is present, likely standing sentinel."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic dark fairy tale medium shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, capturing a dark wood table interior illuminated by warm candlelight with deep chiaroscuro shadows, with a shallow depth of field emphasizing the book and the figure. Gaunt and imperious Granny, wearing a high-collared black Victorian dress, stands over the table, her liver-spotted hands gripping a heavy, leather-bound book. Her thin lips are pressed into a permanent line of disapproval, and her silver-white hair is pulled into a severe tight bun. \n\nGranny's appearance (face, hair, body, expression, and black Victorian dress) MUST exactly replicate the reference from Image 0. \n\nThe environment, including the dark wood table and the lighting (warm candlelight shadows/chiaroscuro), MUST replicate the atmosphere and elements seen in Image 1, adjusted for a medium shot focused on the table.\n\nThe proportion and lighting must match: Granny's scale must fit naturally within the dark wood table interior environment, and the lighting on her must be consistent with the warm candlelight casting deep chiaroscuro shadows, ensuring she looks physically embedded in the space. The shot must have a shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, and include a 35mm film grain texture.\n\nThe overall style MUST adhere to: Photorealistic dark fairy tale, Hollywood blockbuster production quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, rich cinematic color grade with desaturated earth tones and one vivid accent color, volumetric god rays in forest scenes, warm candlelight interiors with deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture, practical lighting sources, every surface tactile and weathered, atmospheric fog and rain.\n"
