Full Story Narrative

### Scene 1 — THE CONSPIRACY (forest, dusk)

**Shot 1:** EXTREME CLOSE-UP of the Fox's gloved hand pressing the small, corked glass vial containing the dark sleeping draught into Red's bare palm. The texture contrast—smooth leather against porcelain skin—is stark. Camera remains static, emphasizing the secretive tension. Sound is muffled forest ambience, punctuated by the distant, echoing calls of crows.

**Shot 2:** TWO-SHOT, intimate, framed low. Red and the Fox stand face to face, breath misting between them as thin fog curls around their ankles. A slow dolly pushes forward, emphasizing the fraction of an inch separating their lips. Red's green-hazel eyes burn with desperate longing. The Fox’s amber eyes are razor-sharp. His voice is a low, breathy rasp: "Ten beats of the clock. No hesitation." The sound is heavy breathing and the whisper of wind through the high canopy.

**Shot 3:** MEDIUM SHOT. Their kiss is brief, fierce, and final—a promise and a seal of fate. The camera holds steady on the intensity. Emotion is passion mixed irrevocably with dread. A single, sharp bird call cuts the moment, followed by profound silence.

**Shot 4:** WIDE SHOT from high up. The Fox melts away, his dark coat billowing like smoke as he recedes into the deepening fog. Red stands utterly alone on the narrow path beneath the towering oaks. She deliberately pulls the deep crimson hood up over her beautiful hair, squaring her shoulders. The slow crane move captures the vast, oppressive scale of the dark forest surrounding her. The sound is the rising swell of a low, mournful cello drone in the musical score.

### Scene 2 — GRANNY'S CRUELTY (cottage interior, flashback + forest path, present)

**Shot 1:** CLOSE-UP. Interior flashback: Young Red, perhaps eight years old, sits rigid on the floor, face illuminated by the flickering orange glow of the fireplace. Granny's massive, severe shadow engulfs her. The camera is static, focusing tightly on the tension in the child’s jaw. Emotion is pure, internalized fear. The only sound is the loud, rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock, overlaid by Granny's cold voice, sharp and cutting, heard faintly offscreen.

**Shot 2:** MEDIUM SHOT flashback. Granny, gaunt and imposing, slams a heavy leather-bound book shut onto a dark wood table. "Sentiment is weakness, child. It invites the teeth." The camera executes a slight, invasive push-in on young Red’s face as her lower lip trembles but her eyes visibly harden, locking down any outward display of tears. The crack of the book slamming echoes fiercely, the sound overriding all else.

**Shot 3:** MATCH CUT to the present. Adult Red’s eyes, displaying that exact same, terrible hardness, track forward. She walks the forest path, hood drawn low, her wicker basket swinging rhythmically. It is a slow, deliberate tracking shot alongside her, keeping pace with her measured stride. The score transitions from bass to tense, rising strings.

**Shot 4:** CLOSE-UP, ground level. Red’s worn leather boot steps precisely over a thick, gnarled root crossing the path. The focus is entirely on this step—a symbolic crossing of a final threshold. All music and ambient sound immediately drop out, replaced by the sharp, solitary *thud* of a single heartbeat.

### Scene 3 — THE CRIME (cottage interior, night)

**Shot 1:** MEDIUM SHOT of the cottage’s back window opening inward. The Fox, dressed in black, forces the iron latch with practiced ease, slipping between the shadows like mercury. He is silent save for the subtle scrape of metal. In the foreground, the rocking chair creaks faintly as Granny sits immobile by the dying embers. The camera uses slight handheld movement to convey predatory stealth. Sound is the latch, the chair’s slow creak, and the soft *pop* of wood in the fire.

**Shot 2:** CLOSE-UP on Granny’s face, half-lit by embers. Her eyes snap wide open—not in panic, but in sharp, icy recognition as the Fox’s shadow falls over her. The camera remains unnervingly static. The rocking stops instantly. An absolute, suffocating silence descends upon the room, broken only by the faintest sound of the fire dying.

**Shot 3:** POV from behind Granny, looking toward the front door. Three soft, polite knocks echo: *tap… tap… tap.* Red’s voice is like spun honey: "Granny? I brought your linens." The heavy oak door opens, revealing Red framed in the light, her face a perfect mask of innocent filial concern. The camera is static from deep inside the cottage, treating the entry as high theater.

**Shot 4:** OVER-THE-SHOULDER shot from just behind Granny’s empty rocking chair. The Fox is visible standing to one side, a dark sentinel. Red steps fully into the room from the other side. Their eyes meet across the dark interior, locking over the rigid, still figure sitting between them. It is a silent confirmation that their pact is sealed. The camera executes a slow rack focus, passing from Red’s relieved face to the Fox’s approving gaze. The grandfather clock begins its steady, ominous *tick-tock* once more.

### Scene 4 — THE COVER (cottage interior + exterior, rain)

**Shot 1:** ACTION SHOT, low angle looking up. The heavy oak door splinters violently inward as the Woodsman bursts through, axe raised high. His plaid shirt is dark with sudden, heavy rain, his face etched with fierce purpose. The camera dramatically frames him against the cottage interior. Sound is the massive *CRACK* of the wood breaking, mingling with the roar of the downpour outside.

**Shot 2:** MEDIUM SHOT. Red launches herself forward, collapsing over the shrouded, body-sized bundle in the rocking chair, her velvet cloak instantly soaking wet. She points a trembling, lace-cuffed hand toward the broken back window, her voice ragged with expertly manufactured despair: "A beast! It fled into the pines!" The camera settles at Red’s eye level, emphasizing the raw emotion of her performance.

**Shot 3:** TWO-SHOT. The Woodsman nods gravely, his honest face grim. He gently lifts the blanket-wrapped shape. He casts a single, respectful glance toward Red before turning and shouldering his way back out the ruined door into the deluge. The camera follows his heavy movement to the threshold. The sound of the rain seems to engulf everything as he steps out.

**Shot 4:** SILHOUETTE SHOT captured from a dark, dry vantage point behind the cottage window glass. Red and the Fox stand side-by-side, watching the Woodsman’s broad silhouette shrink against the backdrop of the dark, rain-swept forest. As his shape vanishes, Red subtly allows the mask to slip; a small, triumphant smile touches her lips for the first time. The camera remains locked on this moment of victory. The rain sounds soften, and the score briefly swells with soaring, hopeful strings.

### Scene 5 — THE TWIST (cottage interior, silence)

**Shot 1:** CLOSE-UP. Red is alone in the dim foyer. Her crimson hood is down, and her hair cascades freely. Her face is relaxed, radiant with the first genuine expression of relief seen in the film. She reaches one slender, free hand toward the heavy iron door handle. The camera executes a slow, intimate dolly forward, anticipating her freedom. The score cuts out completely; only absolute, heavy silence remains.

**Shot 2:** MEDIUM SHOT. Red’s fingers grip the handle, and she pulls the massive door shut. A deep, resonant *THUD* reverberates through the stone structure, signaling finality. She turns, breathing out a silent sigh of success. The camera holds on her face, waiting for the aftermath of her triumph. The reverberation of the closing door fades into nothingness.

**Shot 3:** WIDE SHOT of the cluttered cottage interior. Absolute stillness. Then, from the deepest shadows near the heavy, dark burgundy bedroom curtain, a secondary shadow detaches itself. Granny steps out smoothly from behind the fabric—her silver hair immaculate, her black Victorian dress perfect, untouched by the staged attack. A thin, cruel, triumphant smile stretches her lips. The camera begins a slow, creeping dolly toward her figure, building immense, mounting dread. As she draws closer, the sound returns—a single, excruciatingly high, sustained violin note begins to keen. Granny’s voice is barely a breath, yet it fills the air: "Did you really think I wouldn't know, dear?"

**Shot 4:** EXTREME CLOSE-UP on Red's face. In one horrifying instant, every emotion she possessed—the hope, the triumph, the memory of the Fox’s touch—is violently scoured away. Her porcelain skin blanches, her beautiful hazel eyes widen into perfect circles of paralyzing, utterly silent horror. Her lips part mid-breath, unable to form a scream. The camera holds, unblinking, refusing to look away. The high violin cuts out, replaced by one final, deep, resonant bass note that vibrates in the silence. SLOW FADE TO BLACK.
