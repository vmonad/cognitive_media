No distinct characters are fully visible, the frame is dominated by abstract, glitching visuals and the momentary appearance of what looks like a CGI medieval KNIGHT captured mid-swing with a sword. The overall scene and 'glitching visuals' should reference Image 0, but the 'CGI medieval KNIGHT captured mid-swing with a sword' should reference Image 3."
