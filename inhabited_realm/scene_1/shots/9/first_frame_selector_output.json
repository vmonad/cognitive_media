The face must reference Image 0 to match Mara's appearance, including her organic irises and sharp, geometric pupils and woven skin texture. The overall composition, expression of a silent scream strongly conveying fear/struggle, and the background implying the lower body phasing into a digital void should reference Image 1. The lower body phasing effect, represented by a dissolving static outline into a lower digital void, should be consistent with the modification suggested for Image 1."
