She is looking across a narrow, collapsing virtual bridge, referencing the setting and composition of Image 2. On the far side, positioned centrally, stands an impossibly perfect, androgynous figure embodying pure digital structure, draped in shimmering, fragmented data textures, gazing downward toward the bridge, referencing Image 1 for this figure's appearance. The overall scene, lighting, and style should reference Image 2."
