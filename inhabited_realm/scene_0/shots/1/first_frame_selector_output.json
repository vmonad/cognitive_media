Her eyes are tightly closed, suggesting deep concentration or immersion. A thin sheen of perspiration is visible near the cranial interface port located on her temple. The light reflecting in her pupils is a sharp, pure artificial cinema glow. The lighting and composition should reference Image 0, while Mara's facial expression, closed eyes, and the perspiration/sheen should reference Image 1."
