Thousands of IMMERSION PODS must be arranged around a central SPIRE. The SPIRE is bathed in pulsing NEON BLUE light coming from a colossal DOME overhead. Glowing FIBER OPTIC CABLES should visibly connect the pods to the spire. The composition must emphasize the scale and density of the high-tech environment, mirroring a futuristic, rainy night scene."
