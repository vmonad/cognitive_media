The background should entirely be harsh, screeching WHITE STATIC suggesting complete sensory overload or a systemic failure. The lighting should be overwhelmingly bright and uniform, reflecting off the skin. The facial features of the woman should reference Image 0. The overall composition, lighting, and background effect (white static) should reference Image 1."
