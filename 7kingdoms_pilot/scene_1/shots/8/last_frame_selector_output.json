            "CANONICAL front-view portrait of Morgath. This is the definitive reference for this character's face and identity. Devastatingly beautiful real human woman, appears early 40s. Porcelain-pale skin with natural texture. Large dark nearly-black eyes with no warmth. High sharp cheekbones. Full crimson lips. Long straight raven-black hair falling heavy like a curtain. Tall, slender. Wears a fitted black gown with high structured collar embroidered with dark crimson thread. A blood-red jewel hangs on a gold chain around her neck."

            "A photorealistic medieval fantasy extreme close-up, shot with Arri Alexa 65 and Panavision anamorphic lenses, focusing tightly on the face of the slender woman with porcelain-pale skin and long raven-black hair. The lighting deepens the shadows cast by her high, structured black collar, leaving the lower half of her face in shadow except for the slight reflection of candlewax visible in her large, nearly-black eyes, which are fixed downward with unsettling stillness. A 35mm film grain texture is visible. Ambient sound is low; the only score element is a silence pregnant with anticipation."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: \nA photorealistic medieval fantasy extreme close-up, shot with Arri Alexa 65 and Panavision anamorphic lenses, focused tightly on the face of the slender woman, Morgath. Morgath's appearance (face, hair, skin tone, expression) MUST exactly replicate Image 0, while the composition and lighting MUST reference Image 2. Her facial plane is now dominated by a slow, predatory smile curving her full crimson lips. Her large, nearly-black eyes still reflect candlewax, but the unsettling, calculated stillness in her gaze is replaced by a look of cold satisfaction. Her costume details, including the gown and necklace, MUST exactly replicate Image 0. The silhouette and hair from the back MUST reference Image 1. In the immediate foreground, partially obscuring the woman's jawline, is the clenched fist of an infant. The lighting must maintain the deep chiaroscuro shadows described in Image 2, emphasizing the texture of her face skin and the rich blacks of her attire, consistent with the visual style.\n\nMandatory Visual Style: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Rich dark crimson-and-black for the Witch's scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors."
