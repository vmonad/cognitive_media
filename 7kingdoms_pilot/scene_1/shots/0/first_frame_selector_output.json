            "Reference establishing shot of location 'throne_room': A vast, oppressive medieval throne room at deep night. The architecture features high vaulted ceilings supported by massive stone pillars draped with heavy, richly colored tapestries (now being slashed). The floor is polished dark marble reflecting the flickering light of numerous braziers and wall sconces, which cast long, dramatic, high-contrast shadows across the scene. The atmosphere is one of sudden, brutal chaos—overturned heavy wooden furniture (thrones, tables) made of dark oak and gilded metal litter the floor. The air feels thick with dust and violence. Weather is irrelevant as the scene is entirely indoors, but the lighting suggests stormy nighttime conditions outside, though we don't see it."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: \nA photorealistic medieval fantasy close-up of a black screen, overlaid with a stark, grainy texture characteristic of old, damaged 35mm film stock, suggesting the beginning of an archival recording. No discernable figures or environmental elements are present. The lighting is flat blackness, and the only visual characteristic is the textural grain. The overall style MUST adhere to the mandatory visual style directive: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm golden palette for the peaceful kingdom, cold blue-grey for the coup and escape, rich dark crimson-and-black for the Witch's scenes, warm earthy tones for the village, luminous golden light for magic scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors. The specific close-up texture and grain should reference Image 0, focusing only on the textural quality and blackness."
