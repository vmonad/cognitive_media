            "Reference establishing shot of location 'throne_room': A vast, oppressive medieval throne room at deep night. The architecture features high vaulted ceilings supported by massive stone pillars draped with heavy, richly colored tapestries (now being slashed). The floor is polished dark marble reflecting the flickering light of numerous braziers and wall sconces, which cast long, dramatic, high-contrast shadows across the scene. The atmosphere is one of sudden, brutal chaos—overturned heavy wooden furniture (thrones, tables) made of dark oak and gilded metal litter the floor. The air feels thick with dust and violence. Weather is irrelevant as the scene is entirely indoors, but the lighting suggests stormy nighttime conditions outside, though we don't see it."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy wide shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, capturing the massive throne room doors of dark, thick wood banded with iron, currently intact. The scene is dominated by cold, blue-grey moonlight mixing with the light of dying torch fire, creating very sharp chiaroscuro contrast. The low-angle perspective is established, looking toward the closed doorway which dominates the central background. No figures are visible yet near the door or in the foreground. The environment, lighting, and atmosphere must exactly replicate the setting from Image 0, but modified to show the massive throne room doors of dark, thick wood banded with iron dominating the central background and closed. The lighting must be cold, blue-grey moonlight mixing with the light of dying torch fire, creating very sharp chiaroscuro contrast, as described in the frame, maintaining the photorealistic medieval fantasy style directive for texture and fidelity.\n\nVisual Style: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses.
