            "A photorealistic medieval fantasy close-up shot, utilizing a shallow depth of field with anamorphic bokeh, focuses tightly on the face of the visibly pregnant woman with olive skin and amber eyes. She is captured precisely mid-turn, facing slightly away from the camera's direction but turning toward the side of the frame. Her expression is one of agonizing defeat; her amber eyes are brimming with tears, and the tension in her jaw muscles is apparent as she struggles internally. The lighting is dim and cold, emphasizing the rough texture of ancient stone that begins to edge into the frame from the sides."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy close-up shot, composed with shallow depth of field and creamy anamorphic bokeh, focuses on the face of the visibly pregnant woman. She is captured in profile or three-quarters view, yielding completely as she is half-pulled through a narrow stone opening, which frames the edges of the shot with its rough texture. Her body posture has collapsed, showing complete surrender, and tears are visible on her face as she stares towards the unseen object pulling her. \n\nQueen Lyara's appearance (face, hair, skin tone, amber eyes, crown, clothing, and pregnancy) MUST exactly replicate the portrait reference in Image 1 and Image 2 and Image 4. Facial expression and tension MUST also copy the emotional state shown in Image 4. The environment, including the rough stone opening and the specific lighting (dim, cold/blue-grey chiaroscuro and shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh), MUST reference the atmosphere and lighting quality seen in Image 4 and Image 0. Characters must be placed at correct proportional scale within the environment. Lighting on the character must match the environment's light sources (direction, color temperature, intensity). The overall visual style MUST be Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, featuring deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, and 35mm film grain texture. Ensure every surface is tactile."
