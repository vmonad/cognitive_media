            "Reference establishing shot of location 'throne_room': A vast, majestic medieval throne room constructed from pale, smoothly cut stone blocks. High vaulted ceilings are supported by thick, carved pillars. Sunlight streams in through tall, arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, giving the atmosphere a bright, stable feeling, though slightly aged. Large, colorful banners representing seven distinct kingdoms hang between the pillars, slightly drooping. A massive, imposing throne made of dark, polished wood or iron, possibly adorned with silver, dominates the center. The light is predominantly natural daylight, but warm, flickering glow from a large, central hearth casts deep, shifting shadows near the edges and corners of the hall."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description and style directive. The image should be a photorealistic medieval fantasy Wide Shot of the entire Throne Room, establishing the setting from Image 0, which provides the grand hall, dark stone columns, banners, and general lighting setup. The lighting must be warm golden daylight streaming from tall windows, matching the atmosphere of Image 0. \n\nPlace Morgath in the scene: Towards the far right of the frame, standing among the courtiers near the throne (which is the centerpiece from Image 0), stands Morgath. \n\nMorgath's appearance MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 1. She must be wearing the fitted black gown with a high structured collar and the blood-red jewel on a chain at her throat, as depicted in Image 1. Her long straight raven-black hair should be replicated from Image 1. She must be FULLY VISIBLE, properly scaled to the environment/courtiers (as in Image 0), and organically lit by the same warm golden window light illuminating the room, ensuring her pale face and black gown reflect the light naturally, avoiding shadow or silhouette, referencing the light quality on the stone in Image 0. She watches the throne with dark unblinking eyes.\n\nThe overall style must adhere to: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm golden palette. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors."
