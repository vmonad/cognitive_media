            "A photorealistic medieval fantasy Medium Close Up, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with anamorphic lenses, of a noble king seated on an imposing dark stone throne. King Edran has a strong weathered face with a short grey-streaked dark beard, deep brown eyes, and the silver Crown of Sevens on his head. Warm flickering firelight from the right illuminates one side of his face, creating deep chiaroscuro shadows. He wears rich dark leather and blue velvet robes. The throne room background shows dark stone walls, fire braziers, and banners. Shallow depth of field. 35mm film grain."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image based on the following guidance, adhering strictly to the visual style: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm golden palette for the peaceful kingdom, cold blue-grey for the coup and escape, rich dark crimson-and-black for the Witch's scenes, warm earthy tones for the village, luminous golden light for magic scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors.\n\nThe scene is a Medium Close Up, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with anamorphic lenses, focusing on King Edran seated on an imposing dark stone throne in a throne room. The overall composition and lighting should replicate the environment and camera work of Image 2.\n\nKing Edran MUST exactly replicate his face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 0, though his expression should be a warm smile, referencing the regal but approachable appearance suggested by the scene context. His clothing should be rich dark leather and blue velvet robes as seen in Image 2.\n\nStanding slightly to his left is Queen Lyara. Her appearance MUST exactly replicate her face, hair color, hair style (long dark auburn hair, matching her typical description), skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 1, but she must be wearing a deep emerald silk gown with gold embroidery instead of the garb in Image 1. She places a hand gently on his shoulder. She must look resilient and beautiful, with olive skin and amber eyes.\n\nBoth characters must be scaled proportionally within the environment. They are both to be illuminated naturally by the warm firelight coming from the right, creating deep chiaroscuro shadows, matching the lighting setup in Image 2. Courtiers should be visible softly in the background with shallow depth of field/anamorphic bokeh."
