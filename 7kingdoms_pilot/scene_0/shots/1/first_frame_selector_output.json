            "Reference establishing shot of location 'throne_room': A vast, majestic medieval throne room constructed from pale, smoothly cut stone blocks. High vaulted ceilings are supported by thick, carved pillars. Sunlight streams in through tall, arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, giving the atmosphere a bright, stable feeling, though slightly aged. Large, colorful banners representing seven distinct kingdoms hang between the pillars, slightly drooping. A massive, imposing throne made of dark, polished wood or iron, possibly adorned with silver, dominates the center. The light is predominantly natural daylight, but warm, flickering glow from a large, central hearth casts deep, shifting shadows near the edges and corners of the hall."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy Medium Close Up, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with anamorphic lenses, of a noble king seated on an imposing dark stone throne. The King Edran's appearance MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 1, including the Crown of Sevens. The profile and body shape viewed while seated should reference Image 2. The setting is the throne room, which should reference Image 0, including dark stone walls, fire braziers (implied by the firelight), and banners; however, the background should have a shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh. Warm flickering firelight from the right illuminates one side of his face, creating deep chiaroscuro shadows, matching the lighting style suggested by the fire in Image 0 and the overall required style. He wears rich dark leather and blue velvet robes; the costume (armor and cloak) should primarily reference the textures and material quality shown in Image 1 and 2, adapted to the described robes. 35mm film grain texture must be present. Ensure correct proportional scale: King Edran must look physically embedded in the space, seated on the throne matching the dominance of the throne in Image 0. The overall visual style MUST adhere strictly to:\nPhotorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm golden palette for the peaceful kingdom. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors."
