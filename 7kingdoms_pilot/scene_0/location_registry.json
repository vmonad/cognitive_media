        "description": "Reference establishing shot of location 'throne_room': A vast, majestic medieval throne room constructed from pale, smoothly cut stone blocks. High vaulted ceilings are supported by thick, carved pillars. Sunlight streams in through tall, arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, giving the atmosphere a bright, stable feeling, though slightly aged. Large, colorful banners representing seven distinct kingdoms hang between the pillars, slightly drooping. A massive, imposing throne made of dark, polished wood or iron, possibly adorned with silver, dominates the center. The light is predominantly natural daylight, but warm, flickering glow from a large, central hearth casts deep, shifting shadows near the edges and corners of the hall."
