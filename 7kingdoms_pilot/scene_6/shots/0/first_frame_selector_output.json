            "Reference establishing shot of location 'throne_room': A vast, imposing throne room within a dark castle, characterized by heavy baroque or gothic architecture. The primary focus is a massive, ornate, floor-standing mirror with a dark, possibly obsidian or heavily aged silver frame. The room is lit dimly by unseen, low-intensity ambient light sources, casting deep shadows that are emphasized by the mirror's light-absorbing surface, creating a feeling of oppressive, ominous royalty. The atmosphere is cold and still. Time is night. Weather is implied to be indoors, focusing on the cavernous, heavy atmosphere."
