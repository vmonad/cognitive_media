            "Reference establishing shot of location 'throne_room': A vast, imposing throne room within a dark castle, characterized by heavy baroque or gothic architecture. The primary focus is a massive, ornate, floor-standing mirror with a dark, possibly obsidian or heavily aged silver frame. The room is lit dimly by unseen, low-intensity ambient light sources, casting deep shadows that are emphasized by the mirror's light-absorbing surface, creating a feeling of oppressive, ominous royalty. The atmosphere is cold and still. Time is night. Weather is implied to be indoors, focusing on the cavernous, heavy atmosphere."

            "CANONICAL front-view portrait of Elara (Young Woman). This is the definitive reference for this character's face and identity. A real human young woman of 18. Striking — she has her mother's amber eyes and her father's strong jaw. Wild untamed dark auburn hair. Sun-freckled skin from living outdoors. Lean athletic build from years of farm work. Wears a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy CLOSE UP, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, focused entirely on the dark, vast, and highly reflective surface of a massive MIRROR. The mirror must have the ominous obsidian or heavily aged silver frame from Image 0. The surface appears completely black and still, absorbing light, replicating the texture and darkness seen in Image 0. The lighting must use deep chiaroscuro shadows, emphasizing the deep blackness of the glass, matching the atmosphere of Image 0. Deep 35mm film grain texture is visible across the surface. The overall visual style must strictly adhere to: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm golden palette for the peaceful kingdom, cold blue-grey for the coup and escape, rich dark crimson-and-black for the Witch's scenes, warm earthy tones for the village, luminous golden light for magic scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors."
