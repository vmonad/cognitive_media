            "CANONICAL front-view portrait of Morgath. This is the definitive reference for this character's face and identity. Devastatingly beautiful real human woman, appears early 40s. Porcelain-pale skin with natural texture. Large dark nearly-black eyes with no warmth. High sharp cheekbones. Full crimson lips. Long straight raven-black hair falling heavy like a curtain. Tall, slender. Wears a fitted black gown with high structured collar embroidered with dark crimson thread. A blood-red jewel hangs on a gold chain around her neck."

            "Reference establishing shot of location 'throne_room': A vast, imposing throne room within a dark castle, characterized by heavy baroque or gothic architecture. The primary focus is a massive, ornate, floor-standing mirror with a dark, possibly obsidian or heavily aged silver frame. The room is lit dimly by unseen, low-intensity ambient light sources, casting deep shadows that are emphasized by the mirror's light-absorbing surface, creating a feeling of oppressive, ominous royalty. The atmosphere is cold and still. Time is night. Weather is implied to be indoors, focusing on the cavernous, heavy atmosphere."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy close-up shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, capturing the face of a woman. This woman MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 1. Her expression is one of enraged astonishment, with her full crimson lips slightly parted. Her face is now smeared with fine, dark glass dust. Intense, sharp, bright reflections momentarily flash across her face, illuminated by the scattered shards. Shallow depth of field keeps her face sharp while the immediate foreground and background melt into intense, specular anamorphic bokeh flares from thousands of razor-sharp dark glass fragments tumbling in the air just inches from the lens. The lighting on her face must be sharp and dramatic, matching the deep chiaroscuro and specular reflection style implied by the environment in Image 0, specifically capturing the light sources suggested by the flashing glass shards. The overall visual style must adhere to the mandatory directive: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Rich dark crimson-and-black for the Witch's scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile."
