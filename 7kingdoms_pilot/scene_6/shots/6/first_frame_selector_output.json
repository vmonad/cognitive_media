            "Reference establishing shot of location 'throne_room': A vast, imposing throne room within a dark castle, characterized by heavy baroque or gothic architecture. The primary focus is a massive, ornate, floor-standing mirror with a dark, possibly obsidian or heavily aged silver frame. The room is lit dimly by unseen, low-intensity ambient light sources, casting deep shadows that are emphasized by the mirror's light-absorbing surface, creating a feeling of oppressive, ominous royalty. The atmosphere is cold and still. Time is night. Weather is implied to be indoors, focusing on the cavernous, heavy atmosphere."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy wide shot capturing the center of a chamber, utilizing deep chiaroscuro shadows and shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh. The composition is dominated by an ornate MIRROR set against a dark wall. The lighting is dramatic, featuring warm, deep shadows heavily implying an interior space associated with the character in black. The mirror's surface is reflective. No characters are initially visible in sharp focus, only the environment before the violent action initiates. The environment/setting, including the throne room architecture and the ornate mirror, MUST exactly replicate Image 0. This scene must also subtly incorporate the background seen in Image 1, maintaining congruence with the throne room environment from Image 0, but without the character present for the violent action.\n\nVisual Style: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Rich dark crimson-and-black for the Witch's scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors."
