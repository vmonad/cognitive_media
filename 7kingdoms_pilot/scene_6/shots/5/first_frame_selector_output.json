            "Reference establishing shot of location 'throne_room': A vast, imposing throne room within a dark castle, characterized by heavy baroque or gothic architecture. The primary focus is a massive, ornate, floor-standing mirror with a dark, possibly obsidian or heavily aged silver frame. The room is lit dimly by unseen, low-intensity ambient light sources, casting deep shadows that are emphasized by the mirror's light-absorbing surface, creating a feeling of oppressive, ominous royalty. The atmosphere is cold and still. Time is night. Weather is implied to be indoors, focusing on the cavernous, heavy atmosphere."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality CLOSE UP, framed with Panavision anamorphic lenses, on the large, dark, nearly-black eyes of the woman in the fitted black gown. The lighting is the oppressive, deep crimson and black light characteristic of her chamber (reference the lighting and atmosphere from Image 2), casting sharp, chiaroscuro shadows across her porcelain-pale skin and high sharp cheekbones. Her eyes are wide with residual shock, the focus sharp on the texture of her irises and the surface tension around the eyes, which show subtle muscle spasms.\n\nMorgath's appearance (face, hair, clothing, overall features) MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 0. The character MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 1. The general profile and body outline should reference Image 1. The expression and the specific close-up details of the face, particularly the eyes, should be guided by the emotional state and framing in Image 3, maintaining the general appearance established by Image 0.\nThe overall mood, lighting, and environment (oppressive, deep crimson-and-black) must conform to the established visual style and atmosphere found in Image 2. The scene should imply the dark throne room (Image 2) with dramatic chiaroscuro lighting.\n\nVisual Style: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Rich dark crimson-and-black for the Witch's scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors."
