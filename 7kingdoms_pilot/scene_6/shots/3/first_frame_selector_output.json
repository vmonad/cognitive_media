            "CANONICAL front-view portrait of Morgath. This is the definitive reference for this character's face and identity. Devastatingly beautiful real human woman, appears early 40s. Porcelain-pale skin with natural texture. Large dark nearly-black eyes with no warmth. High sharp cheekbones. Full crimson lips. Long straight raven-black hair falling heavy like a curtain. Tall, slender. Wears a fitted black gown with high structured collar embroidered with dark crimson thread. A blood-red jewel hangs on a gold chain around her neck."

            "CANONICAL front-view portrait of Elara (Young Woman). This is the definitive reference for this character's face and identity. A real human young woman of 18. Striking — she has her mother's amber eyes and her father's strong jaw. Wild untamed dark auburn hair. Sun-freckled skin from living outdoors. Lean athletic build from years of farm work. Wears a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown."

            "Reference establishing shot of location 'throne_room': A vast, imposing throne room within a dark castle, characterized by heavy baroque or gothic architecture. The primary focus is a massive, ornate, floor-standing mirror with a dark, possibly obsidian or heavily aged silver frame. The room is lit dimly by unseen, low-intensity ambient light sources, casting deep shadows that are emphasized by the mirror's light-absorbing surface, creating a feeling of oppressive, ominous royalty. The atmosphere is cold and still. Time is night. Weather is implied to be indoors, focusing on the cavernous, heavy atmosphere."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description, matching the visual style: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm golden palette for the peaceful kingdom, cold blue-grey for the coup and escape, rich dark crimson-and-black for the Witch's scenes, warm earthy tones for the village, luminous golden light for magic scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. The scene must visually conform to the dark, imposing atmosphere and architecture of Image 2.\n\nA photorealistic medieval fantasy over-the-shoulder Medium Shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, positioned behind the imposing silhouette of a woman, here referred to as Foreground Figure. Foreground Figure MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 0 (Morgath's portrait, focusing on her raven-black hair falling heavy like a curtain, and her dark eyes). The Foreground Figure's silhouette should be slightly out of focus.\nThe reflection within the large ornate mirror (which should look like the one in Image 2) appears as a real human young woman, here referred to as Reflected Figure. The Reflected Figure MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 1 (Elara's portrait, noting her wild untamed dark auburn hair, sun-freckled skin, athletic build, and simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown).\nThe light catching the high sharp cheekbones of the Foreground Figure suggests a strong, perhaps unseen, light source originating from the mirror. The Foreground Figure is intensely rigid, her large dark nearly-black eyes betraying a flicker of unguarded shock. The scene is dominated by rich dark crimson-and-black lighting tones, emphasizing deep chiaroscuro shadows. Ensure both characters are placed at correct proportional scale within the environment and that lighting on characters matches the environment's light sources."
