Story Title: Blood of the Crown

The pilot spans these two timelines, showing the collapse of the Seven Kingdoms and the secret survival of the exiled princess. Now a young woman living as a peasant, Elara’s latent royal power awakens during a moment of anger.

Full Story Narrative:

### Scene 1 — THE MAP AND THE KING

**Shot 1:** The scene opens on an aged parchment map filling the frame. It is hand-drawn with stunning detail in ink and gold leaf, depicting a vast continent divided into seven distinct regions. The camera slowly pans across the expanse, lingering on flourishing coastlines and sharp mountain ranges. A deep, resonant **NARRATOR'S VOICE** fills the space: "Seven kingdoms, one crown. For a generation, the peace held, forged by the wisdom of one man against the eternal hunger of the wild lands." The orchestral theme begins, grand and sweeping.

**Shot 2:** A **MATCH DISSOLVE** transitions the texture of the parchment directly into the reality of the Throne Room. King Edran sits upon the huge, pale stone throne. Warm firelight from iron braziers casts shifting shadows on his strong, weathered face and the silver-threaded Crown of Sevens upon his head. He exudes quiet authority. Beside him, Queen Lyara, visibly pregnant, watches the court proceedings. The atmosphere is stable, if heavy: "Sir Kaelan, the harvest yields are acceptable, but the Northern Pass remains porous," Edran states in his deep baritone.

**Shot 3:** A **WIDE SHOT** captures the grandeur of the hall—the vaulted ceilings, the seven Kingdom banners drooping slightly from the rafters, the assembled courtiers. Golden light streams through the narrow windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. It is a picture of absolute, if temporary, stability. The warm score swells gently, carrying the barely perceptible undertone of finality.

### Scene 2 — THE COUP

**Shot 1:** **NIGHT.** The court is dismissed. Silence. The camera is static on a dark patch of floor near the steps of the throne. A dagger is drawn from a sheath—the steel gleaming faintly under residual torchlight—the sound of steel sliding unnervingly loud.

**Shot 2:** The **WIDE SHOT** violently erupts. Shadowy assassins in black surge from the recesses of the hall. Chaos is instantaneous: furniture overturns, fire catches on a tapestry. King Edran leaps up, drawing his sword instantaneously, the movement practiced and lethal. Handheld camera work makes the violence kinetic and immediate. Screams and the sickening clang of steel against steel dominate the sound mix.

**Shot 3:** **CLOSE-UP.** Edran is struck—a dark blade finding his side beneath his practical armor. He collapses to his knees, his strength failing. His deep brown eyes lock across the devastation onto Lyara. Through sheer will, he manages a single blurred word: "Go." The ambient battle sounds suddenly muffle and fade. A single, heartbreaking cello note holds as the camera **RACK FOCUSES** from Edran's dying gaze to Queen Lyara’s horror-stricken face.

**Shot 4:** **MEDIUM SHOT.** Sir Aldren, the scarred Knight, slams into the Queen just as she tries to rise. She clutches a swaddled newborn—Princess Elara—to her chest. Aldren hauls her toward a disguised stone arch behind the throne. Lyara screams, reaching back toward the gilded crib near the throne where the **NEWBORN PRINCE CAEL** is now wailing. Aldren’s voice is a gravelly whisper: "We cannot, Your Grace! The passage now!"

**Shot 5:** The massive throne room doors burst inward. **SLOW MOTION.** Morgath enters, perfectly composed amid the carnage. Her porcelain-pale skin seems to absorb the candlelight. Her raven hair streams behind her, and the blood-red jewel on her throat pulses faintly. She walks with unsettling grace past the dying guards, untouched. The camera is low-angle, looking up at her terrifying beauty as she reaches the crib. She looks down at the crying Prince Cael, and a slow, predatory smile spreads across her crimson lips. The comforting score is abruptly replaced by Morgath's dark, almost seductive cello motif.

### Scene 3 — THE ESCAPE

**Shot 1:** **MEDIUM SHOT.** Claustrophobic darkness envelops the Queen, the Knight, and the infant princess. They navigate the narrow, damp stone tunnel beneath the castle. Their single torch throws erratic light, highlighting dripping water on mossy walls. The camera tracks closely behind them, emphasizing their desperation. The sounds of fighting echo distantly, replaced by heavy, ragged breathing and the baby’s stifled whimpers.

**Shot 2:** **CLOSE-UP.** Lyara’s face, illuminated by the sputtering torch. Tears cut clean paths through the grime on her olive skin. Her amber eyes are no longer soft, but diamond-hard. She rocks her daughter fiercely. Her voice is snatched by fear: "I won't let them take you too."

**Shot 3:** **WIDE SHOT.** They emerge onto the forest floor. It is just past dawn; thick, cold mist blankets the ground. Behind them, high on the ridge, the castle burns against the darkening sky. The camera pulls back slowly, making the three figures—a Queen, a Knight, and a baby—look infinitesimally small against the massive, indifferent forest landscape. The lonely string score begins.

**Shot 4:** **MEDIUM SHOT.** In the pale forest light, Aldren kneels before Lyara, his armor scratched and muddied. His gruff voice is devoid of emotion: "Your Grace, we must disappear. The girl must never know." Lyara looks down at the infant in her arms, the weight of her crown replaced by the weight of survival. She nods once, a silent, agonizing acceptance of exile. **FADE TO BLACK.**

### Scene 4 — THE WITCH ASCENDS

**Shot 1:** **WIDE SHOT.** The Throne Room is transformed. Dark drapes smother the windows, hundreds of black candles illuminate the room, and the recognizable banners have been replaced by Morgath’s shifting, dark crimson threads. Morgath sits on the stone throne, the unsettling crown of black iron thorns heavy on her head. Beside the throne, Prince Cael sleeps peacefully in his gilded crib. The camera executes a slow, deliberate dolly toward her.

**Shot 2:** **CLOSE-UP.** Morgath consults an enormous, ancient book opened on a pedestal. The script glows faintly with a sickly green light. The camera tightens on her face, her dark, calculating eyes reflecting the unnatural luminescence. Her voice is silky, musical, overriding the quiet in the room: "The thousand-year moon rises in eighteen years. The blood must be pure. The blood must be royal."

**Shot 3:** **MEDIUM SHOT.** She leans down over the crib. She ignores the royal cradle of the kingdom, focusing only on the baby. With a long, black-gloved finger, she gently strokes Cael’s cheek. The baby gurgles sleepily, completely placated. Morgath’s lips curl into what is almost an expression of fondness—a horrifying, possessive tenderness. Her twisted lullaby motif swells.

### Scene 5 — YEARS LATER

**Shot 1:** **ESTABLISHING SHOT.** Text fades in: "18 YEARS LATER." The view is of a humble farming village waking up in the morning mist. Thatched roofs droop slightly, domestic animals move through muddy lanes. The camera drifts silently past the scene. The soundscape is pure pastoral: roosters crowing, distant sheep bleating.

**Shot 2:** **MEDIUM SHOT.** Elara (18) is indistinguishable from the other workers. She wears a rough-spun peasant dress of faded brown, her dark auburn hair wild and tangled. She is laughing, hauling a heavy wooden yoke between two neighbors. Her build is lean and athletic from labor, not courtliness. The camera tracks alongside her, capturing the uncomplicated rhythm of her life.

**Shot 3:** **CLOSE-UP.** Elara is engaged in a sharp, quick argument with another villager over a dropped basket of grain. Her temper flares instantly. As her frustration peaks, the air around her violently **SHIMMERS**. The wood grain on a nearby fence post cracks audibly. Dry leaves, resting on the ground, abruptly float upward and spin momentarily. Elara gasps, staring down at her own calloused hands. The amber of her mother’s eyes briefly catches the sunlight and flashes with an internal, golden light. The village sounds cut out, replaced by a low, resonant golden **HUM**.

### Scene 6 — THE AWAKENING

**Shot 1:** **ESTABLISHING SHOT.** A hidden clearing in a dense, old-growth forest dappled with bright sunlight. A clear stream chatters over mossy stones. Queen Lyara (now late 50s, her beauty weathered by hardship; dressed in dark, practical peasant garb) stands waiting for Elara. The camera sets a wide frame, showing the calm seclusion of the spot.

**Shot 2:** **MEDIUM SHOT.** Lyara speaks, telling Elara everything—the bloodline, the throne, the coup, the death of King Edran. We do not hear the words, only a rising, aching cinematic string score. Elara’s face contorts through disbelief, searing anger, and profound grief as the truth of her borrowed life collapses around her. The camera performs a slow, tight push-in on her shifting expression.

**Shot 3:** **CLOSE-UP.** Elara breathes deeply, then raises a hand toward the stream. A vibrant, warm **GOLDEN LIGHT** streams from her fingertips. The current in the stream visibly slows, hesitates, and then violently reverses its flow against gravity. Mossy stones lift silently into the air, drawn by an invisible force. Her amber eyes glow intensely, fully alight with power. The golden HUM builds into a rich, soaring crescendo.

**Shot 4:** **TWO-SHOT.** Elara lowers her hand, the power receding, but her eyes remain luminous as she fixes her gaze on her mother. Her unpolished voice carries sudden, undeniable authority: "And my brother?" Lyara can barely look up, whispering: "The Witch has him." Elara’s jaw locks, the carefree peasant girl gone, replaced by a regal warrior. "Then I’m going back." Her eyes flare gold again. The hero’s bold, determined theme cuts in. **CUT TO BLACK.**

### Scene 7 — THE WITCH KNOWS

**Shot 1:** **MEDIUM SHOT.** Morgath's chamber. The hundreds of candles provide the only light. She stands silently before a massive, ornate mirror that seems to absorb light rather than reflect it. She is utterly motionless, as eternally poised as she was eighteen years ago. Her cello motif plays very faintly, a shadow of sound.

**Shot 2:** **CLOSE-UP of the Mirror.** The dark surface ripples like disturbed water. A shock of vibrant GOLDEN LIGHT appears within the glass, followed by the clear, determined image of a young woman’s face—Elara. The distinct golden HUM clashes violently with Morgath’s dark music. The camera pushes hard into the reflection, the boundary between the worlds blurring.

**Shot 3:****EXTREME CLOSE-UP.** Morgath’s face. For the very first time since her introduction, composure shatters. Her eyes fly wide, her crimson lips part in an unguarded expression of true fear. She gasps the confirmation, so soft it’s almost lost: "The King’s daughter lives." The ornate mirror violently **SHATTERS**, sending shards of dark glass exploding outward across the frame. The camera locks on Morgath’s startled, furious face amidst the falling debris. One final, ominous, echoing musical note rings out. **HARD CUT TO BLACK.**
