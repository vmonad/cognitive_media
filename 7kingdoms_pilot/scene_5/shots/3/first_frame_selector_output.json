            "CANONICAL front-view portrait of Elara (Young Woman). This is the definitive reference for this character's face and identity. A real human young woman of 18. Striking — she has her mother's amber eyes and her father's strong jaw. Wild untamed dark auburn hair. Sun-freckled skin from living outdoors. Lean athletic build from years of farm work. Wears a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown."

            "Reference establishing shot of location 'forest_clearing': A secluded, verdant forest clearing bathed in bright daylight. Dappled sunlight streams through a dense, high canopy of deciduous trees, casting shifting patterns of light and shadow onto the ground. The floor is covered in thick, vibrant green moss growing over large, rough-hewn stones. A small, shallow stream chatters across the clearing, water flowing clear over smooth pebbles. The atmosphere is initially calm and naturalistic, suggesting mid-morning or early afternoon on a clear, sunny day. Textures should emphasize damp moss, rough bark, and clear running water."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: \nA photorealistic medieval fantasy CLOSE UP, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. The subject is <Elara> (Young Woman), focusing tightly on her lower face, emphasizing a subtle tremor in her lower lip, and her amber eyes widely expressing raw disbelief. <Elara>'s appearance MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 1. The immediate background, featuring parts of a stream and moss, should reference the luminous golden light and dappled lighting characteristics described in Image 0, but dissolved into a creamy, soft bokeh suggestive of a magical environment, utilizing a very shallow depth of field typical of anamorphic lenses. The facial lighting must create deep chiaroscuro shadows, and a 35mm film grain texture must be apparent. <Elara> must be placed at correct proportional scale within the environment, and the lighting on <Elara> must match the luminous golden light sources suggested by the magical environment bokeh. Characters must look physically embedded in the space, not composited on top. The overall style must strictly adhere to: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Luminous golden light for magic scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax."
