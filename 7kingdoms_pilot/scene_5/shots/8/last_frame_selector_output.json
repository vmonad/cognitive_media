            "CANONICAL front-view portrait of Elara (Young Woman). This is the definitive reference for this character's face and identity. A real human young woman of 18. Striking — she has her mother's amber eyes and her father's strong jaw. Wild untamed dark auburn hair. Sun-freckled skin from living outdoors. Lean athletic build from years of farm work. Wears a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown."

            "A photorealistic medieval fantasy reverse-angle two-shot, framed with Elara (Young Woman) dominant in the foreground on the left, her determined face filling that half of the frame. Her amber eyes faintly glow with residual golden energy. Queen Lyara is visible slightly behind her to the right, her expression a tense mixture of hope and terror. The dense forest canopy creates a high contrast, with diminishing, fading light filtering down, casting long shadows and lending a sense of urgency. The shallow depth of field emphasizes the tactile quality of the young woman's rough-spun peasant dress and sun-freckled skin. Ambient sound suggests silence broken by faint, distant forest ambience (e.g., rustling leaves, subdued wind). Score: A very low, tense string drone begins, hinting at commitment."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy close-up, framed on Elara's resolute expression. Her amber eyes MUST exactly replicate the color and faint golden luminescence from Image 0. The background surrounding her head must be indistinct, consisting of deep, creamy anamorphic bokeh suggestive of the dense forest canopy structure seen in Image 2. The diminishing, somber light seen on Elara in Image 2 should define the lighting across her features. The texture of her rough garment collar (MUST exactly replicate the fabric and style from Image 0) and the slight tension around her jaw MUST be sharply defined by the shallow focus. Elara's entire appearance—face, build, hair, and clothing—MUST exactly replicate Image 0. The frame should emulate the lighting and photorealistic mood of Image 2, which is set in a dark forest environment (environment inspiration from Image 2, but heavily blurred/bokeh for the close-up requirement). The visual style MUST adhere to: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm golden palette for the peaceful kingdom, cold blue-grey for the coup and escape, rich dark crimson-and-black for the Witch's scenes, warm earthy tones for the village, luminous golden light for magic scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors."
