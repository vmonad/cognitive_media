            "Reference establishing shot of location 'forest_clearing': A secluded, verdant forest clearing bathed in bright daylight. Dappled sunlight streams through a dense, high canopy of deciduous trees, casting shifting patterns of light and shadow onto the ground. The floor is covered in thick, vibrant green moss growing over large, rough-hewn stones. A small, shallow stream chatters across the clearing, water flowing clear over smooth pebbles. The atmosphere is initially calm and naturalistic, suggesting mid-morning or early afternoon on a clear, sunny day. Textures should emphasize damp moss, rough bark, and clear running water."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: \nA photorealistic medieval fantasy wide shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, captures a secluded forest clearing under dappled sunlight creating moving patterns of golden light and deep chiaroscuro shadows on mossy stones and a chattering stream in the foreground. The environment should replicate the look and feel of Image 3 (the forest clearing environment, lighting, and textures). Queen Lyara, late 50s, weathered face, wearing dark, practical peasant garb that shows dust and wear, stands patiently center-left, facing slightly toward the right edge of the frame. Queen Lyara's overall appearance, including face, body shape, and especially the dark, practical peasant garb (not the royal attire), MUST exactly replicate the appearance from Image 0. Her pose and silhouette from behind should reference Image 2 to establish the body positioning, but she must be facing slightly toward the right edge of the frame as described. The shot must emphasize the earthy palette and capture heavy anamorphic lens flare through the canopy, matching the atmospheric lighting style of Image 3 and the character inclusion style of Image 4 while maintaining the hyper-realistic, high-quality medieval fantasy aesthetic and visual style directives, including tactile surfaces, deep chiaroscuro shadows, and anamorphic bokeh.\n\nCharacter Identity Requirements:\n- Queen Lyara MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 0 (for her facial features and general look, substituting the peasant garb described here for the royal attire in Image 0). The transition to dark, practical peasant garb should be consistent with the description in Image 0.\n- The character's overall body posture and silhouette should reference Image 2, adapted to face slightly toward the right edge of the frame.\n\nEnvironment and Lighting Requirements:\n- The environment (forest clearing, mossy stones, stream) MUST reference Image 3.\n- The integration of the character into the environment MUST follow the photorealistic embedding style of Image 4, ensuring correct proportional scale, and that lighting on Queen Lyara matches the dappled, golden sunlight and deep shadows of the forest clearing environment (Image 3)."
