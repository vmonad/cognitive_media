            "A photorealistic medieval fantasy medium shot, slightly lower than eye-level, focused on the figure wearing dark, practical peasant garb, who has olive skin and amber eyes. The figure's posture is rigid, their face displaying deep lines of stress and suppressed pain around the eyes, illuminated by warm, shifting forest light. The rough wool of the garment contrasts with the velvet green moss in the background, which is rendered with a shallow depth of field and creamy anamorphic bokeh. The figure's lips are closed, their expression set."

            "CANONICAL front-view portrait of Elara (Young Woman). This is the definitive reference for this character's face and identity. A real human young woman of 18. Striking — she has her mother's amber eyes and her father's strong jaw. Wild untamed dark auburn hair. Sun-freckled skin from living outdoors. Lean athletic build from years of farm work. Wears a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description, adhering strictly to the visual style: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm earthy tones dominate the scene. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors.\n\nA photorealistic medieval fantasy medium shot, slightly lower than eye-level. The primary figure, Queen Lyara, is positioned centrally or left-of-center, wearing dark, practical peasant garb. Her appearance MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 0, but adapted to the peasant garb shown in Image 1. Her posture remains relatively rigid, her face showing deep lines of stress and suppressed pain around the eyes. She is illuminated by warm, shifting forest light, matching the lighting detail in Image 1. The background remains a velvet green mossy area with creamy anamorphic bokeh, consistent with the environment in Image 1.\n\nThe second figure, Elara, wearing a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown, stands partially visible on the far right. Her appearance MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 2. Her hands are clenching her rough skirt, similar to her posture in Image 2. The clothing texture and skin tone must look physically embedded within the environment, matching the lighting conditions of the forest scene in Image 1. Ensure correct proportional scale for both figures within the environment based on Image 1."
