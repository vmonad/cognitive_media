    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy medium shot, slightly lower than eye-level, focused on one figure. The figure's appearance (face, skin tone, hair style) MUST exactly replicate the features of Queen Lyara from Image 1. The posture, rigid stance, and overall figure silhouette MUST replicate the composition and pose of the figure on the left in Image 4, but the facial expression must be replaced to show deep lines of stress and suppressed pain around the eyes, with closed lips, reflecting a set expression, while retaining the olive skin and amber eyes from Image 1. This figure MUST be wearing the dark, practical peasant garb described for Queen Lyara in Image 1's description, not the outfit in Image 4. The lighting on the figure must match the warm, shifting forest light seen in Image 4, emphasizing strong backlighting and dappled shadows. The background should be the forest setting of Image 4, rendered with a shallow depth of field and creamy anamorphic bokeh. The texture of the rough wool garment must contrast with the velvet green moss in the background. The overall style MUST adhere to the high-quality photorealistic medieval fantasy look described in the visual style directive, including deep chiaroscuro shadows and 35mm film grain texture, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses."
