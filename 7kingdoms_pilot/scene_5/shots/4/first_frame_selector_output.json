            "Reference establishing shot of location 'forest_clearing': A secluded, verdant forest clearing bathed in bright daylight. Dappled sunlight streams through a dense, high canopy of deciduous trees, casting shifting patterns of light and shadow onto the ground. The floor is covered in thick, vibrant green moss growing over large, rough-hewn stones. A small, shallow stream chatters across the clearing, water flowing clear over smooth pebbles. The atmosphere is initially calm and naturalistic, suggesting mid-morning or early afternoon on a clear, sunny day. Textures should emphasize damp moss, rough bark, and clear running water."

            "CANONICAL front-view portrait of Elara (Young Woman). This is the definitive reference for this character's face and identity. A real human young woman of 18. Striking — she has her mother's amber eyes and her father's strong jaw. Wild untamed dark auburn hair. Sun-freckled skin from living outdoors. Lean athletic build from years of farm work. Wears a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy extreme close-up, shot with anamorphic lenses and visible film grain, focusing on the lower portion of one hand, slightly smudged with dirt, held against a backdrop of dark, wet, mossy rocks. Intense, violent golden light originates from the fingertips, creating sharp, dramatic chiaroscuro, forcing the surrounding environment into deep shadow. The stream water immediately adjacent to the hand appears unnaturally still and heavy. There is no visible character face, only the hand and immediate environment. \n\nThe hand and immediate environment (dark, wet, mossy rocks, still water effect) should reference Image 0, specifically capturing the material textures and shadow quality, but in an extreme close-up perspective suitable for the described magical event. \n\nSince the character Elara is not visible, we only need her appearance reference established by Image 1 for consistency in any potential surrounding frame context, but mainly to anchor the 'real human actor' requirement for the hand's appearance.\n\nMandatory Visual Style: Photorealistic medieval fantasy aesthetic, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Genuine materials like mud and wet rock must be tactile. Lighting must feature deep chiaroscuro shadows and luminous golden light for the magic effect originating from the fingertips. Include creamy anamorphic bokeh and 35mm film grain texture. The lighting on the hand and rocks must match the intense, dramatic golden light source originating from the fingertips."
