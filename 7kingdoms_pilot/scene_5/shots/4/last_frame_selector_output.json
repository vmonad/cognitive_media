            "CANONICAL front-view portrait of Elara (Young Woman). This is the definitive reference for this character's face and identity. A real human young woman of 18. Striking — she has her mother's amber eyes and her father's strong jaw. Wild untamed dark auburn hair. Sun-freckled skin from living outdoors. Lean athletic build from years of farm work. Wears a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown."

            "Reference establishing shot of location 'forest_clearing': A secluded, verdant forest clearing bathed in bright daylight. Dappled sunlight streams through a dense, high canopy of deciduous trees, casting shifting patterns of light and shadow onto the ground. The floor is covered in thick, vibrant green moss growing over large, rough-hewn stones. A small, shallow stream chatters across the clearing, water flowing clear over smooth pebbles. The atmosphere is initially calm and naturalistic, suggesting mid-morning or early afternoon on a clear, sunny day. Textures should emphasize damp moss, rough bark, and clear running water."

            "A photorealistic medieval fantasy extreme close-up, shot with anamorphic lenses and visible film grain, focusing on the lower portion of one hand, slightly smudged with dirt, held against a backdrop of dark, wet, mossy rocks. Intense, violent golden light originates from the fingertips, creating sharp, dramatic chiaroscuro, forcing the surrounding environment into deep shadow. The stream water immediately adjacent to the hand appears unnaturally still and heavy. There is no visible character face, only the hand and immediate environment."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy extreme close-up, shot with anamorphic lenses and visible film grain, focusing on the lower portion of one hand, slightly smudged with dirt, held against a backdrop of dark, wet, mossy rocks. Intense, violent golden light originates from the fingertips, which now appear static but still radiating power. The stream water in the immediate vicinity is violently flowing upward and backward against gravity. Small, wet, mossy stones are suspended silently in the air around the hand, caught in a chaotic golden swirl. In the upper third of the frame, two amber eyes are unmistakably glowing with intense golden light, framed by the edge of the hand. The only sound is the palpable, powerful golden HUM. The hand and the eye appearance must reference Image 2. The environment—the dark, wet, mossy rocks, the stream, and the dappled light ambiance that is now dominated by intense golden magical light—must reference Image 1. The overall style and lighting, emphasizing deep chiaroscuro and tactile textures, must conform to the VISUAL_STYLE directive, especially the photorealistic medieval fantasy look, anamorphic quality, and golden palette for magic scenes. The character features (amber eyes) MUST exactly replicate the facial features from Image 0. Ensure the hand looks physically embedded in the textured, chaotic magical environment with correct proportional scale and chiaroscuro lighting matching the golden magical source. The visual style must strictly adhere to: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm golden palette for the peaceful kingdom, cold blue-grey for the coup and escape, rich dark crimson-and-black for the Witch's scenes, warm earthy tones for the village, luminous golden light for magic scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors."
