            "CANONICAL front-view portrait of Elara (Young Woman). This is the definitive reference for this character's face and identity. A real human young woman of 18. Striking — she has her mother's amber eyes and her father's strong jaw. Wild untamed dark auburn hair. Sun-freckled skin from living outdoors. Lean athletic build from years of farm work. Wears a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown."

            "A photorealistic medieval fantasy close-up, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, focuses on the face of Queen Lyara, who is visibly pregnant and wearing dark, practical peasant garb. The lighting is soft and dappled, creating deep chiaroscuro shadows and hinting at warm golden palette ambiance filtered through a shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh. Her amber eyes are locked on a point just off-camera, conveying absolute stillness and physical tension, with just the barest movement of her full crimson lips as she whispers. The ambient sound is muted, with a very low cello drone score beginning."

    "text_prompt": "Create a photorealistic medieval fantasy two-shot close-up, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. This image must strictly adhere to the visual style: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm earthy tones characterize the background environment.\n\n**Queen Lyara** (MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 0. Since she is usually pregnant/in the opening scene, her appearance here must match the visual context of Image 2, which shows her in dark peasant garb): must be on one side of the frame, held in silent contemplation, framed by the warm earthy tones of the background environment, suggesting an interior space lit by a single unseen source. Her facial expression must be one of silent contemplation.\n\n**Elara (Young Woman)** (MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, the strong jawline, bone structure, and clothing from Image 1, wearing a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown): must be visible and occupy the opposite side of the initial focus point. Her jaw is visibly clenched, creating taut lines along her strong jawline. Her amber eyes must be intensely illuminated with a luminous golden light, suggesting immediate power activation.\n\nMaintain the appropriate proportional scale for the close-up two-shot format. The lighting on both characters must match the environmental light sources observed in Image 2 for Lyara, while Elara's golden-lit eyes provide a strong internal visual contrast. The low cello drone score is implied under the dialogue.\n\nCrucially, blend the character appearances: Queen Lyara's overall look (clothing/pregnancy status) should lean towards her look in Image 2, while her facial features are anchored to Image 0. Elara's appearance is anchored strictly to Image 1, but her expression must convey tension. The background environment should transition slightly from the forest setting of Image 2 to a warmer, darker interior feel suggested by the description, but maintain the tactile, earthy tones."
