            "Reference establishing shot of location 'forest_clearing': A secluded, verdant forest clearing bathed in bright daylight. Dappled sunlight streams through a dense, high canopy of deciduous trees, casting shifting patterns of light and shadow onto the ground. The floor is covered in thick, vibrant green moss growing over large, rough-hewn stones. A small, shallow stream chatters across the clearing, water flowing clear over smooth pebbles. The atmosphere is initially calm and naturalistic, suggesting mid-morning or early afternoon on a clear, sunny day. Textures should emphasize damp moss, rough bark, and clear running water."
