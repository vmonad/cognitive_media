    "motion_desc": "The shot employs a slow, gradual fade-in from black, transitioning from absolute darkness to the first visible image frame. This gradual illumination reveals the scene. Since no content is described before the fade, the camera remains effectively static and the elements within the frame are static until the light reveals them. Ambient sound layer is silence, score is absent.",
