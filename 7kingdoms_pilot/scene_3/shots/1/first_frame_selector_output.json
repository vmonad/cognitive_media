            "Reference establishing shot of location 'throne_room_wide': A vast, oppressive medieval throne room, completely shrouded in darkness. Heavy, floor-to-ceiling black velvet drapes cover all windows, blocking all natural light. Hundreds of thick, black wax candles are irregularly placed around the room, casting flickering, dramatic shadows and an eerie, warm orange-red glow. The royal banners have been replaced entirely by intimidating crimson, embroidered fabric banners displaying Morgath's sinister sigil. The architecture is heavy stone, Gothic in style. Morgath sits on a massive throne forged from dark, pitted iron, adorned with sharp, thorn-like projections. The atmosphere is suffocatingly silent, broken only by the faint crackle of the many candles. Time is indefinable due to the engineered darkness."

    "text_prompt": "Create a photorealistic medieval fantasy wide shot of a throne room, following the mandatory visual style: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm golden palette for the peaceful kingdom, cold blue-grey for the coup and escape, rich dark crimson-and-black for the Witch's scenes, warm earthy tones for the village, luminous golden light for magic scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors.\n\nThe scene is set in the throne room, which should strictly reference the environment and lighting from Image 0, emphasizing suffocating darkness, heavy black velvet drapes, and dramatic chiaroscuro shadows cast by hundreds of black candles casting a warm orange-red glow.\n\nThe central figure is a woman (the Witch/Morgath), seated on the massive iron throne. Her appearance, including her long straight raven-black hair, spiked crown of black iron thorns, and fitted black gown, must exactly replicate the identity anchors established in Image 0's implied character context (the ruler in the dark throne room). Her pale skin and dark eyes must catch the flickering firelight as shown in the atmosphere described for Image 0.\n\nTo the side or near the throne, resting on the stone floor, is a gilded crib. The infant inside the crib must have an appearance that exactly replicates the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing shown in Image 2. The infant should be lying peacefully inside the crib, wrapped in fine white cloth swaddling, which should be consistent with the clothing shown in Image 2.\n\nThe entire composition must maintain the wide shot perspective and proportions described in the frame description, with proportional scale matching the environment established in Image 0. The lighting on the characters must be the flickering, warm orange-red light established by the candles in Image 0."
