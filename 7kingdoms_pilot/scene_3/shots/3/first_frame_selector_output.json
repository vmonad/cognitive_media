            "Reference establishing shot of location 'throne_room_wide': A vast, oppressive medieval throne room, completely shrouded in darkness. Heavy, floor-to-ceiling black velvet drapes cover all windows, blocking all natural light. Hundreds of thick, black wax candles are irregularly placed around the room, casting flickering, dramatic shadows and an eerie, warm orange-red glow. The royal banners have been replaced entirely by intimidating crimson, embroidered fabric banners displaying Morgath's sinister sigil. The architecture is heavy stone, Gothic in style. Morgath sits on a massive throne forged from dark, pitted iron, adorned with sharp, thorn-like projections. The atmosphere is suffocatingly silent, broken only by the faint crackle of the many candles. Time is indefinable due to the engineered darkness."

            "Reference establishing shot of location 'throne_close_up': A tightly focused shot on an ancient, enormous, leather-bound book resting open on a heavy stone or dark wood pedestal. The script on the thick, yellowed pages emits a vibrant, sickly, internal phosphorescent green light. This green luminescence strongly illuminates the immediate area, catching the texture of the iron thorns on Morgath's crown and reflecting sharply in her dark eyes. The background is deep, heavy shadow, emphasizing the book's magical source of light. Scene atmosphere is intensely focused and arcane."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy medium shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, capturing a low camera angle looking slightly up, following the mandatory visual style directive.\n\nThe setting must be the dimly lit throne room environment from Image 0, lit by flickering candlelight, emphasizing warm tones and deep chiaroscuro shadows with creamy anamorphic bokeh in the background. \nThe figure leaning over the gilded crib must be a woman with long straight raven-black hair, porcelain-pale skin, and wearing a fitted black gown with a high structured collar. This figure's face, sharp and pale, is partially obscured by shadow cast from above, and she should be wearing a long black glove on one hand.\n\n**The Figure (Leaner):** The appearance (face, body, hair, skin tone) and clothing of the leaning figure must exactly replicate a character possessing the menacing, dark aesthetic suggested by the lighting and mood in Image 1 (the oppressive darkness and dramatic shadows), although her face is partially obscured. Since no explicit portrait for the antagonist is provided, reference the oppressive atmosphere and dark styling of Image 1 for the overall look and lighting interaction.\n\n**The Infant Prince (Cael):** The infant prince, visible from the waist up and framed by the ornate gold bars of the crib, MUST be sleeping soundly. The infant prince's appearance (face, hair color, body shape) MUST exactly replicate Image 2. The lighting on Prince Cael must be a mixture of the warm ambient candlelight from the throne room environment (Image 0) and subtle, soft illumination reflecting the gilded crib structure.\n\nEnsure characters are placed at correct proportional scale within the environment. Lighting on characters must match the environment's light sources (flickering candlelight, warm orange-red glow, deep chiaroscuro shadows). Characters must look physically embedded in the space, not composited on top. Maintain the photorealistic medieval fantasy style with 35mm film grain texture, deep chiaroscuro shadows, and shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh."
