=== THE SEVEN KINGDOMS — Pilot: "Blood of the Crown" ===

--- CHARACTER BIBLES ---

KING EDRAN (late 50s, male):
  Appearance: A noble, weathered king in the prime of his twilight years. Strong broad
  face with a short grey-streaked dark beard, deep brown eyes full of warmth and quiet
  authority. Prominent brow, strong jaw. Sun-darkened skin from years of riding and
  campaigning. A face that inspires loyalty — fatherly, wise, but with the hardness of
  a man who has fought wars. Crow's feet at his eyes from smiling. Real human skin — pores,
  lines, stubble texture.
  Wardrobe: Rich but practical — dark leather and deep blue velvet tunic embroidered with
  silver thread. A heavy fur-lined cloak. The Crown of Sevens — a circlet of interlocking
  silver bands, each representing a kingdom. Worn leather boots and a sword belt.
  Voice: Deep, resonant baritone. Speaks with calm measured authority. A voice that fills
  a hall without shouting.

QUEEN LYARA (late 30s, female):
  Appearance: Beautiful in a real, lived-in way — not porcelain perfection but the beauty
  of a woman who has survived. Warm amber-brown eyes, high cheekbones, olive skin. Long
  dark auburn hair that she wears loose in the palace but ties back in the escape. A small
  scar on her chin from childhood. Full lips, strong nose. Slender but not fragile — the
  build of a woman who rides horses. Real skin, no makeup perfection.
  Wardrobe: In the palace: a deep emerald silk gown with gold embroidery. During escape:
  the gown torn and dirtied, a dark travelling cloak thrown over it. She clutches the
  infant princess to her chest.
  Voice: Warm contralto, cultured but not cold. When afraid, her voice becomes tight and
  clipped. When comforting her daughter, impossibly gentle.

THE WITCH — MORGATH (appears early 40s, female):
  Appearance: Devastatingly beautiful and terrifying. Porcelain-pale skin with an almost
  luminous quality. High sharp cheekbones that could cut glass. Large dark eyes — nearly
  black — that hold no warmth, only calculation. Full crimson lips always slightly parted
  in an almost-smile. Long raven-black hair that falls straight and heavy like a curtain.
  She is tall, slender, and moves with unsettling grace — like a predator pretending to
  be human. She looks ageless — could be 30 or 300. Her beauty is the kind that makes you
  uneasy. Real skin texture but unnaturally flawless, which itself feels wrong.
  Wardrobe: A fitted black gown with a high structured collar, embroidered with dark
  crimson thread in patterns that seem to shift. A thin crown of black iron thorns sits
  on her head after the coup. Long black gloves. A blood-red jewel on a chain at her throat.
  Voice: Silky, measured, almost musical. She speaks softly — everyone leans in to hear her,
  which is how she controls rooms. When angry, her voice drops to a deadly whisper.

SIR ALDREN — THE KNIGHT (mid 40s, male):
  Appearance: A scarred, battle-hardened knight with an honest, craggy face. Short-cropped
  grey-brown hair, heavy stubble. A deep scar running from his right ear to his chin. Broad
  shoulders, thick arms — a swordsman's build. Tired eyes that have seen too much. He moves
  with the economical precision of a career soldier. Broken nose set slightly crooked.
  Wardrobe: Dented, scratched plate armor over chainmail — the armor of a knight who actually
  fights, not a parade soldier. A blue cloak (the King's colors) now torn and bloodied
  during the escape. A longsword and a dagger.
  Voice: Gruff, low, no-nonsense. Speaks only when necessary. Northern accent.

THE PRINCESS — ELARA (age 18 in later scenes, infant in early scenes):
  As infant: A swaddled newborn in the Queen's arms.
  As young woman (18): Striking — she has her mother's amber eyes and her father's strong
  jaw. Wild, untamed dark auburn hair (her mother's color). Sun-freckled skin from living
  outdoors as a commoner. Lean, athletic build from years of physical labor. She doesn't
  know she's beautiful — she carries herself like a farmhand, not a princess. When her
  powers manifest, her eyes flicker with a faint golden light.
  Wardrobe: Simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy browns and greys, a worn leather
  belt, bare feet or simple sandals. A faded cloth wrapped around her wrist — the only
  remnant from the palace (she doesn't know its origin).
  Voice: Bright, impulsive, unpolished. She speaks fast when excited. When angry, she
  sounds exactly like her mother.

THE NEWBORN PRINCE — CAEL:
  As infant: A baby left in a gilded crib in the throne room during the chaos.
  Not seen as older in the pilot — only referenced. He is kept alive by Morgath because
  his royal blood is needed for the ritual.

--- LOCATIONS ---

THE MAP OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS:
  An aged parchment map, hand-drawn with ink and gold leaf, showing a vast continent
  divided into seven distinct regions — forests, mountains, coastlines, deserts, plains,
  islands, and a frozen north. Each kingdom has a sigil. The map fills the frame as a
  narrator's voice describes the world.

THE THRONE ROOM OF EDRAN'S KEEP (interior):
  A massive stone throne room with soaring vaulted ceilings and tall narrow windows. The
  throne is carved from a single block of pale grey stone, ancient and simple — not ornate.
  Iron braziers line the walls. Banners of the seven kingdoms hang from the rafters. Cold
  grey stone floors. During the coup: overturned tables, blood on the stone, fire spreading.

THE SECRET TUNNEL (interior):
  A narrow, ancient stone passageway beneath the castle. Torch-lit, dripping water, low
  ceiling. Cobwebs and moss. The Queen runs through it carrying the infant princess, the
  Knight behind them with a drawn sword. Distant sounds of fighting echo from above.

THE WITCH'S CHAMBER (interior):
  Morgath's private chamber after she takes the throne. The cold stone room has been
  transformed — dark drapes, hundreds of black candles, a massive ornate mirror that
  seems to hold shifting shadows. An ancient book lies open on a stone pedestal — the
  ritual text. The crib with the baby prince sits nearby, untouched, almost tenderly
  arranged.

A RURAL VILLAGE — YEARS LATER (exterior):
  A humble farming village — thatched-roof cottages, muddy lanes, chickens and goats.
  Rolling green hills in the background. Morning mist. Elara (18) works in a field,
  indistinguishable from any other village girl.

THE FOREST CLEARING — POWER AWAKENING (exterior):
  A hidden clearing in a dense forest. Dappled sunlight through the canopy. A stream
  runs through mossy rocks. This is where Elara discovers her powers — the air around
  her shimmers with golden light, leaves float upward, the stream reverses its flow.

--- STORY ---

The pilot opens on the map of the Seven Kingdoms with a narrator's voiceover establishing
the world — seven kingdoms united under one crown, a fragile peace held together by
King Edran, a just and beloved ruler.

Scene 1 — THE MAP AND THE KING: The animated map. Voiceover describes three of the
kingdoms and their nature. We transition from the map to the real world — the throne room,
where King Edran sits on the stone throne, the Crown of Sevens on his head, presiding
over his court with quiet authority. His pregnant Queen Lyara sits beside him. Peace
reigns. But shadows gather.

Scene 2 — THE COUP: Night. Morgath's forces strike without warning. Assassins flood the
throne room. King Edran is stabbed — he fights but is overwhelmed. As he falls, he
locks eyes with Queen Lyara and mouths one word: "Go." The Knight, Sir Aldren, grabs
the Queen (who has just given birth — the infant princess in her arms) and drags her
toward the hidden passage behind the throne. In the chaos, the newborn prince Cael,
in his crib near the throne, is left behind. Lyara screams for her son but Aldren
forces her into the tunnel. The throne room doors burst open — Morgath enters, calm amid
the carnage, and walks to the crib. She looks down at the baby prince and smiles.

Scene 3 — THE ESCAPE: The Queen, the Knight, and the infant princess flee through the
dark tunnel beneath the castle. Water drips, their torchlight flickers. The sounds of
slaughter echo behind them. They emerge into a dark forest at dawn. Lyara clutches her
daughter, weeping silently. Aldren kneels before her: "Your Grace, we must disappear."
They vanish into the world — the Queen becomes a commoner, the Princess grows up never
knowing who she is.

Scene 4 — THE WITCH ASCENDS: Morgath sits on the stone throne, the iron thorn crown on
her head. The baby prince sleeps in a gilded crib beside her. She opens the ancient ritual
book — the text glows faintly. Her dark eyes reflect the light. She speaks to no one:
"The thousand-year moon rises in eighteen years. The blood must be pure. The blood must
be royal." She strokes the baby's cheek with a gloved finger — almost tenderly. She will
raise him. She will keep him alive. She will use him.

Scene 5 — YEARS LATER: A rural village. Morning mist. Elara (18) works in a field —
rough-spun dress, sun-freckled skin, calloused hands. She looks like any other village
girl. Her mother (the Queen, now aged and worn, dressed as a peasant) watches from a
cottage doorway. Elara argues with another villager — gets angry — and the air SHIMMERS.
A wooden fence post cracks. Leaves float upward. Elara stares at her own hands in shock.

Scene 6 — THE AWAKENING: The forest clearing. Lyara has brought Elara here. She tells
her the truth — who she is, who her father was, what was taken from them. Elara's eyes
fill with tears, then harden. She raises her hand — golden light swirls from her fingers,
the stream reverses, stones lift from the ground. She has power she never knew. She looks
at her mother: "And my brother?" Lyara: "The Witch has him." Elara's jaw sets: "Then I'm
going back." Her eyes glow gold. Cut to black.

Scene 7 — THE WITCH KNOWS: Morgath's chamber. She stands before her dark mirror. The
mirror ripples — showing a glimpse of golden light, a girl's face. Morgath's expression
shifts from composure to something she has never shown before: fear. She whispers: "The
King's daughter lives." The mirror shatters. BLACK. Title card.
