Epic medieval fantasy series pilot, Hollywood big-budget production. 7 scenes with 3-5 shots
each. Kill Bill chapter-style structure — each scene opens with a narrator voiceover that
frames the chapter, then plays out with full dialogue so the audience can follow the story
entirely through speech. This is a SERIES PILOT — end on a cliffhanger.

Scene 1 — CHAPTER ONE: THE SEVEN KINGDOMS (3 shots):
  Shot 1: The aged parchment map fills the frame. Camera slowly pans across the continent.
    NARRATOR (deep, aged male voice, like a historian telling a legend): "There were seven
    kingdoms, each proud, each ancient. And for a generation, one man held them together —
    not by conquest, but by trust. His name was Edran. And this is the story of how his
    world was taken from him."
    Emotion: epic scale. Sound: narrator voiceover, subtle orchestral theme building.
  Shot 2: MATCH DISSOLVE from the map to the throne room. King Edran on the stone throne,
    Crown of Sevens on his head. Queen Lyara beside him, visibly pregnant. Warm firelight.
    Camera slow dolly in. EDRAN (deep, resonant baritone): "Seven banners hang in this hall.
    Seven kingdoms at peace. Let us drink to another year of it." The court cheers. LYARA
    (warm contralto, hand on her belly): "The children will know a world without war, my
    love." EDRAN (smiling): "That is all I ever wanted."
    Emotion: warmth, doomed happiness. Sound: cheering, goblets raised, fire.
  Shot 3: WIDE SHOT of the full hall — banners, courtiers, golden light. Camera holds wide.
    The score swells warmly, then an ominous undertone creeps in. The camera lingers on a
    SHADOW at the edge of the hall — someone watching from the darkness.
    Emotion: paradise about to fall. Sound: score shifts to minor key.

Scene 2 — CHAPTER TWO: THE NIGHT OF KNIVES (5 shots):
  Shot 1: BLACK SCREEN. NARRATOR: "It came without warning. On the night of the harvest
    feast, when every sword was sheathed and every guard was drunk on wine." FADE IN on a
    CLOSE-UP of a dagger being drawn. Camera static. Sound: steel sliding, silence.
  Shot 2: WIDE SHOT — the throne room erupts. Assassins in black flood in. King Edran draws
    his sword, fights two assassins. EDRAN (roaring): "To arms! Protect the Queen!" He cuts
    one down but more keep coming. Camera handheld, chaotic. Sound: steel, screams, crashing.
  Shot 3: CLOSE-UP. Edran is stabbed through the back. He falls to his knees. His eyes find
    Lyara across the chaos. EDRAN (barely a whisper, his dying breath): "Take our daughter.
    Go. Live." Camera rack focus from his face to hers. LYARA (screaming): "EDRAN!" Sound:
    battle fades to muffled. Score: devastating cello.
  Shot 4: MEDIUM SHOT. Sir Aldren grabs Lyara — she's clutching the newborn princess. He
    drags her toward the hidden passage. LYARA (desperate, reaching back): "My son! Cael is
    still in his crib!" ALDREN (gruff, anguished): "If we go back, we all die. Your daughter
    needs her mother alive." Lyara's face breaks. She lets herself be pulled into the tunnel.
    Sound: Lyara sobbing, the baby crying, fighting behind them.
  Shot 5: SLOW MOTION. The throne room doors open. Morgath enters in her black gown, raven
    hair, crimson jewel. She walks calmly through blood and bodies. She reaches the crib
    where baby Cael cries. She picks him up gently. MORGATH (silky, soft, almost tender):
    "Shhh. Shhh. Your father's crown is mine now, little prince. But you... you I will keep."
    She smiles. Camera low angle. Sound: silence except her voice and the baby. Score: dark
    seductive cello theme.

Scene 3 — CHAPTER THREE: THE TUNNEL (4 shots):
  Shot 1: BLACK SCREEN. NARRATOR: "The Queen fled through the veins of the old castle —
    passages built a thousand years ago for this very purpose. She carried her daughter, and
    left her son behind. It was the choice that would haunt her for eighteen years." FADE IN
    on the dark tunnel. Torchlight on wet stone. Camera tracking behind them.
    Sound: dripping water, distant fighting, heavy breathing.
  Shot 2: CLOSE-UP. Lyara's face — tears, jaw clenched, clutching the baby. LYARA (whispering
    to the infant): "I will come back for him. I swear it. On your father's name, I swear it."
    Camera holds. Sound: her ragged breathing.
  Shot 3: WIDE SHOT. They emerge from a hidden archway into a forest at dawn. The castle
    burns distantly. Mist everywhere. ALDREN (kneeling, gruff): "Your Grace, the Witch will
    search every road and every village. We must become no one. The girl must never know who
    she is — not until she's ready." LYARA (looking at her daughter, then at the burning
    castle): "She will know. When the time comes, she will know everything."
    Sound: birdsong, distant fire. Score: lonely strings.
  Shot 4: They walk into the mist, away from camera. Two figures and a baby, disappearing
    into the world. NARRATOR: "And so the Queen of Seven Kingdoms became a peasant woman
    with no name, raising a princess who thought she was nobody." FADE TO BLACK.
    Sound: score fades. Silence.

Scene 4 — CHAPTER FOUR: THE WITCH'S PATIENCE (3 shots):
  Shot 1: BLACK SCREEN. NARRATOR: "Morgath took the throne. She took the crown. And she took
    the boy. Not out of mercy — out of hunger. For Morgath had read the old texts, and she
    knew what the prince's blood could buy her." FADE IN on Morgath on the stone throne,
    iron thorn crown, the baby prince in a gilded crib beside her. Dark candles everywhere.
    Camera slow dolly in. Sound: silence, candles flickering.
  Shot 2: CLOSE-UP. Morgath opens the ancient book. Pages glow faintly. Her black eyes
    reflect the light. MORGATH (soft, deliberate, each word savored): "The thousand-year moon.
    It rises when he turns eighteen. One ritual. One sacrifice. Royal blood, freely given or
    taken by force. And I will have power that no mortal has held since the world was young."
    Camera tight on her face. Sound: a low hum from the book.
  Shot 3: MEDIUM SHOT. She reaches into the crib, strokes the baby's cheek with a gloved
    finger. MORGATH (almost a lullaby whisper): "I will feed you. I will teach you. I will
    make you love me, little prince. And when the moon rises... you will give me everything."
    The baby gurgles. She almost smiles. Camera holds. Emotion: evil disguised as love.
    Sound: baby sounds. Score: her cello theme twisted into a lullaby.

Scene 5 — CHAPTER FIVE: THE GIRL WHO DIDN'T KNOW (3 shots):
  Shot 1: BLACK SCREEN. TEXT ON SCREEN: "18 YEARS LATER." NARRATOR: "The Queen kept her
    word. She hid among common folk, in a village so small it had no name. And she raised
    her daughter as a farmer's child — strong, stubborn, and completely unaware of the blood
    that ran in her veins." FADE IN on the rural village at dawn. Thatched roofs, muddy lanes,
    mist. Camera drifts through. Sound: roosters, sheep, morning birds.
  Shot 2: MEDIUM SHOT. Elara (18) carries a heavy basket through the village, laughing with
    a friend. She's rough-spun, freckled, wild-haired. ELARA (bright, fast, unpolished):
    "If old Harren charges me double for flour again, I swear I'll dump it in his well."
    FRIEND (laughing): "You wouldn't dare." ELARA (grinning): "Try me."
    Camera tracking alongside. Emotion: a normal girl, a normal life. Sound: village bustle.
  Shot 3: CLOSE-UP. A villager bumps Elara hard, spilling her basket. VILLAGER (sneering):
    "Watch where you're going, orphan girl." Elara's eyes flash with anger. The air SHIMMERS.
    The wooden fence post beside them CRACKS. Leaves float UPWARD. Everyone freezes. Elara
    stares at her own hands. ELARA (whispering, terrified): "What... what did I just do?"
    Camera holds on her stunned face. Sound: sudden silence, then a golden HUM.

Scene 6 — CHAPTER SIX: THE TRUTH (4 shots):
  Shot 1: BLACK SCREEN. NARRATOR: "The Queen had waited eighteen years for this moment.
    She had prayed it would never come. And she had prayed it would." FADE IN on the forest
    clearing. Dappled sunlight, stream, mossy rocks. Lyara (now late 50s, worn, peasant dress)
    stands with Elara. Camera wide. Sound: water, birdsong.
  Shot 2: MEDIUM SHOT. Lyara faces Elara. LYARA (voice steady but breaking): "Your name is
    not Elara the farmer's daughter. Your name is Elara, firstborn of King Edran, heir to the
    Seven Kingdoms. Your father was murdered. Your brother was taken. And the woman who sits
    on your father's throne... she is not a queen. She is a witch who has waited eighteen
    years to sacrifice your brother's blood for power that will make her immortal." Camera slow
    push-in on Elara's face — shock, denial, anger, tears. Sound: score building.
    ELARA (barely audible): "You're lying." LYARA: "Look at your hands, Elara. You have your
    father's gift. The blood of kings. It was always in you."
  Shot 3: CLOSE-UP. Elara raises her hand. Golden light swirls from her fingers. The stream
    reverses. Stones lift. Leaves spiral in a golden vortex. Her eyes glow warm gold. ELARA
    (voice trembling with wonder and fury): "How long? How long have you known what I am?"
    LYARA (tears flowing): "Since the night I carried you through the dark. Since the night
    I left your brother behind." Camera holds, awestruck. Sound: the golden HUM building.
    Score: soaring, triumphant.
  Shot 4: TWO-SHOT. Elara and Lyara face each other. ELARA (fierce, eyes still glowing):
    "Where is my brother?" LYARA: "The Witch has him. In the castle where your father died."
    ELARA (jaw set, voice like iron — she sounds exactly like her mother): "Then I'm going
    back. And I'm bringing him home." Camera holds on both faces. Score: the hero's theme —
    bold, determined. CUT TO BLACK.

Scene 7 — CHAPTER SEVEN: THE MIRROR (3 shots):
  Shot 1: BLACK SCREEN. NARRATOR: "But in the castle of the seven kingdoms, the Witch had
    eyes everywhere. And mirrors that showed more than reflections." FADE IN on Morgath's
    dark chamber. She stands before the massive ornate mirror. Still beautiful, still ageless.
    Camera static. Sound: silence. Her cello theme, barely audible.
  Shot 2: CLOSE-UP of the mirror. It ripples like dark water. An image forms — golden light,
    a young woman's face. Elara. Camera pushes into the mirror. MORGATH (offscreen, voice
    tightening): "Show me... show me who threatens my crown." The mirror shows Elara's
    glowing eyes, her father's jaw, her mother's fire. Sound: the golden hum clashing with
    the dark cello.
  Shot 3: EXTREME CLOSE-UP. Morgath's face. For the first time in eighteen years, something
    she has never shown: fear. Her dark eyes widen. Her crimson lips part. MORGATH (a deadly
    whisper): "The King's daughter lives. She has the gift." A beat. Then her fear hardens
    into fury. "Find her. Find her before the moon rises. Kill her before she reaches the
    boy." The mirror SHATTERS. Camera holds on her face amid falling glass. Sound: glass
    shattering, then dead silence. Score: one final ominous bass note. HARD CUT TO BLACK.
