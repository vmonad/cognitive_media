            "Reference establishing shot of location 'peasant_village_morning': A small, rustic European peasant village awakening in the early morning. The atmosphere is thick with low, cool mist clinging to the ground and obscuring views beyond a few yards. Architecture consists of extremely humble, single-story dwellings with thick, uneven thatched roofs and walls patched with wattle and daub or roughly hewn timber. The lanes are unpaved, churned earth and mud, glistening slightly in the weak, pale yellow sunlight attempting to break through the mist. Domestic animals like chickens and a few sheep graze nearby. Lighting is soft, diffused, and cool, characteristic of a foggy sunrise in a pastoral setting. The overall mood is humble and sleepy."

            "CANONICAL front-view portrait of Elara (Young Woman). This is the definitive reference for this character's face and identity. A real human young woman of 18. Striking — she has her mother's amber eyes and her father's strong jaw. Wild untamed dark auburn hair. Sun-freckled skin from living outdoors. Lean athletic build from years of farm work. Wears a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown."

            "A photorealistic medieval fantasy CLOSE UP, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, focusing tightly on the face of Elara (Young Woman) (sun-freckled skin, wearing a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown), slightly off-center. She holds a broad, challenging grin, her amber eyes bright. The lighting suggests low morning light with soft, directional illumination emphasizing the texture of her skin. The shallow depth of field renders the background elements softly out of focus, showing the rough texture of a weathered wooden fence post just behind her right shoulder, and hints of dry, dead leaves on the unseen ground below."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy CLOSE UP, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, tightly focused on the face of Elara (Young Woman). Elara MUST exactly replicate the face, hair color, hair style, skin tone, eye color, bone structure, and clothing from Image 1, and her appearance/expression in the environment MUST reference Image 4. Her expression is one of white-hot fury; her amber eyes are wide, showing tension around the jawline and the pores of her skin. A luminous golden shimmer specifically highlights her eyes and the immediate air surrounding her face. The background environment, including the light quality and the wooden fence post behind her shoulder, MUST match the setting and atmosphere established in Image 0, specifically showing the low morning light and mist typical of the peasant village awakening. The wooden fence post directly behind her shoulder is visibly fractured, a distinct crack running across its aged, weathered texture, as seen in Image 4. Dry, dead leaves directly around her feet are visibly lifted and swirling in a tight, upward vortex, seeming to catch the low morning light as golden flecks, consistent with the texture and lighting hints in Image 4. The overall visual style MUST adhere to the directive: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm earthy tones for the village, luminous golden light for magic scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors."
