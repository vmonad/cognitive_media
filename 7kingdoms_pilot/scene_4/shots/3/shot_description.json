    "visual_desc": "CLOSE UP, focusing tightly on <Elara (Young Woman)>'s face, slightly off-center. Her expression shifts abruptly from a broad, challenging grin (as she's about to respond) to sudden, white-hot fury, eyes widening. The facial expression is highly detailed, showing pores and the tension in her jaw. As her anger peaks, the light quality changes rapidly: a brief, intense, luminous golden shimmer overlays her eyes and the immediate air around her (magic manifestation). A rough, weathered wooden fence post just behind her shoulder snaps visibly—a crack shooting across the aged wood texture. Nearby, dry, dead leaves on the ground visibly lift and begin to spin briefly in a tight, upward vortex, catching the low morning light as golden flecks.",
    "variation_type": "medium",
    "variation_reason": "The shot involves significant internal motion, shifting a character's expression from challenging grin to peak fury, accompanied by a dramatic, instantaneous manifestation of magical light and immediate, tangible environmental destruction (snapping post, swirling leaves). This constitutes a medium degree of change in visual focus, driven by intense subject action and associated special effects.",
    "ff_desc": "A photorealistic medieval fantasy CLOSE UP, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, focusing tightly on the face of Elara (Young Woman) (sun-freckled skin, wearing a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown), slightly off-center. She holds a broad, challenging grin, her amber eyes bright. The lighting suggests low morning light with soft, directional illumination emphasizing the texture of her skin. The shallow depth of field renders the background elements softly out of focus, showing the rough texture of a weathered wooden fence post just behind her right shoulder, and hints of dry, dead leaves on the unseen ground below.",

    "lf_desc": "A photorealistic medieval fantasy CLOSE UP, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, tightly focused on the face of Elara (Young Woman) (sun-freckled skin, wearing a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown). Her expression is one of white-hot fury; her amber eyes are wide, showing tension around the jawline and the pores of her skin. A luminous golden shimmer specifically highlights her eyes and the immediate air surrounding her face. The wooden fence post directly behind her shoulder is visibly fractured, a distinct crack running across its aged, weathered texture. Dry, dead leaves directly around her feet are visibly lifted and swirling in a tight, upward vortex, seeming to catch the low morning light as golden flecks.",

    "motion_desc": "Static camera; there is no camera movement. Initially, the face of the individual in the earthy brown dress holds a challenging grin. Abruptly, this morphs into an expression of white-hot fury, characterized by wide-open eyes and noticeable tension in the jaw muscles. Simultaneously with the peak of this fury, a brief, intense, luminous golden shimmer manifests, momentarily overlaying the amber eyes and the air immediately surrounding the face. Concurrently, the rough, weathered wooden fence post situated just behind the shoulder violently snaps, causing a visual crack to shoot across the wood grain. Almost immediately following this, nearby dry, dead leaves on the ground lift and begin to spin rapidly in a tight, upward vortex, catching the low morning light as golden debris.",
    "audio_desc": "[Speaker] <Elara (Young Woman)> (Grinning, challenging): \"Try me.\" [Sound Effect] A sharp, loud CRACK of wood splitting, followed by a brief, almost inaudible rush of displaced air. The surrounding village bustle cuts out instantly. [Speaker] Villager (Harsh, sneering, slightly off-screen): \"Watch where you're going, orphan girl.\""
