            "CANONICAL front-view portrait of Elara (Young Woman). This is the definitive reference for this character's face and identity. A real human young woman of 18. Striking — she has her mother's amber eyes and her father's strong jaw. Wild untamed dark auburn hair. Sun-freckled skin from living outdoors. Lean athletic build from years of farm work. Wears a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown."

The wrong elements should be replaced.\nWrong elements: The context of Elara's upper body, her face, and the overall scene dynamics shown in Shot 2. Shot 4 focuses only on the result of her experience (trembling hands)..\nYou must select this image as the main reference and replace the characters in the image with the provided character portraits.

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: \nAn EXTREME CLOSE UP, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, focusing intently on the hands of a young woman. The hands MUST exactly replicate the skin texture, dirt/mud, callouses, and slight trembling posture shown in Image 1. The hands should appear slightly curled but trembling violently. The clothing visible around the hands (a dirty, earthy brown peasant dress/skirt hem) MUST replicate the material, color, and dirtiness shown in Image 1. A faint, internal golden light must illuminate the hands, as suggested by the lighting in Image 1, contrasting with the dull, earthy brown tones of the background shown in Image 1. Proportionally, the character's hands must occupy the majority of the frame. The overall lighting and atmosphere must match the earthy morning light and shallow depth of field aesthetic exemplified in Image 1. The character's identity (Elara) must be based on Image 0 (the defining portrait reference for Elara).\n\nStyle guide: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm earthy tones for the village, luminous golden light for magic scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors."
