            "Reference establishing shot of location 'peasant_village_morning': A small, rustic European peasant village awakening in the early morning. The atmosphere is thick with low, cool mist clinging to the ground and obscuring views beyond a few yards. Architecture consists of extremely humble, single-story dwellings with thick, uneven thatched roofs and walls patched with wattle and daub or roughly hewn timber. The lanes are unpaved, churned earth and mud, glistening slightly in the weak, pale yellow sunlight attempting to break through the mist. Domestic animals like chickens and a few sheep graze nearby. Lighting is soft, diffused, and cool, characteristic of a foggy sunrise in a pastoral setting. The overall mood is humble and sleepy."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy establishing shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, capturing a peasant village at dawn. The scene is heavily shrouded in cool, pale morning mist. The thatched roofs appear dark and soaked with dew, contrasted with muddy ground. A couple of chickens and a tethered goat drift lazily in the immediate foreground. The lighting is soft and diffused, dominated by cool tones, though a natural, warm golden-hour glow attempts to penetrate the mist. The composition emphasizes textures: visible grain, roughness of thatch, and wetness of the mud. The overall environment and lighting MUST exactly replicate the setting in Image 0. The chickens and goat placement should reference the general placement in Image 0. The visual style MUST be: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm earthy tones for the village, luminous golden light for magic scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors."
