            "CANONICAL front-view portrait of Elara (Young Woman). This is the definitive reference for this character's face and identity. A real human young woman of 18. Striking — she has her mother's amber eyes and her father's strong jaw. Wild untamed dark auburn hair. Sun-freckled skin from living outdoors. Lean athletic build from years of farm work. Wears a simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown."

            "Reference establishing shot of location 'peasant_village_morning': A small, rustic European peasant village awakening in the early morning. The atmosphere is thick with low, cool mist clinging to the ground and obscuring views beyond a few yards. Architecture consists of extremely humble, single-story dwellings with thick, uneven thatched roofs and walls patched with wattle and daub or roughly hewn timber. The lanes are unpaved, churned earth and mud, glistening slightly in the weak, pale yellow sunlight attempting to break through the mist. Domestic animals like chickens and a few sheep graze nearby. Lighting is soft, diffused, and cool, characteristic of a foggy sunrise in a pastoral setting. The overall mood is humble and sleepy."

            "A photorealistic medieval fantasy establishing shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, capturing a peasant village at dawn. The scene is heavily shrouded in cool, pale morning mist. The thatched roofs appear dark and soaked with dew, contrasted with muddy ground. A couple of chickens and a tethered goat drift lazily in the immediate foreground. The lighting is soft and diffused, dominated by cool tones, though a natural, warm golden-hour glow attempts to penetrate the mist. The composition emphasizes textures: visible grain, roughness of thatch, and wetness of the mud."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy close-up shot, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses, following the style: Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Real human actors in practical costumes — genuine leather, real chainmail, wool, silk, mud, rust, sweat. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Real weather — mist, firelight, torchlight, dawn light. Warm golden palette for the peaceful kingdom, cold blue-grey for the coup and escape, rich dark crimson-and-black for the Witch's scenes, warm earthy tones for the village, luminous golden light for magic scenes. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh, 35mm film grain texture. Every surface tactile — stone, iron, parchment, silk, fur, moss, wet rock, candlewax. NOT video game, NOT CGI render, NOT digital art, NOT World of Warcraft, NOT clean fantasy, NOT anime, NOT cartoon, NOT illustrated, NOT stylized, NOT 3D render, NOT Unreal Engine, NOT polished/perfect skin, NOT plastic armor, NOT oversaturated colors.\n\nFocus tightly on the face of a young woman. Her appearance, including her sun-freckled skin, wild untamed dark auburn hair, and simple rough-spun peasant dress in earthy brown with a worn leather belt, MUST exactly replicate Image 1. Her striking amber eyes MUST exactly replicate the eye color and structure from Image 1, but they now glow faintly golden, referencing the luminous golden light style directive. The structure of her face and body visible in the frame MUST reference Image 2 for profile and bone structure context.\nThe woman is positioned such that her face and visible clothing occupy the foreground, consistent with a close-up shot. The background must be obscured by the cool, pale morning mist, rendered as creamy bokeh due to shallow depth of field, referencing the atmosphere of Image 0 and Image 4. Natural dawn light illuminates her face from the front, highlighting the subtle texture of her skin, matching the soft, diffused morning light quality described in Image 0 and Image 4. The characters must be placed at correct proportional scale within the environment, and lighting on the character must match the environment's light sources (direction, color temperature, intensity). The character must look physically embedded in the space, not composited on top."
