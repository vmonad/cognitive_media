            "Reference establishing shot of location 'peasant_village_morning': A small, rustic European peasant village awakening in the early morning. The atmosphere is thick with low, cool mist clinging to the ground and obscuring views beyond a few yards. Architecture consists of extremely humble, single-story dwellings with thick, uneven thatched roofs and walls patched with wattle and daub or roughly hewn timber. The lanes are unpaved, churned earth and mud, glistening slightly in the weak, pale yellow sunlight attempting to break through the mist. Domestic animals like chickens and a few sheep graze nearby. Lighting is soft, diffused, and cool, characteristic of a foggy sunrise in a pastoral setting. The overall mood is humble and sleepy."

There is no visible light source or environmental detail other than the superimposed text. The darkness and mood must match the atmosphere suggested by the lighting/mood of Image 0, but be entirely black as described."
