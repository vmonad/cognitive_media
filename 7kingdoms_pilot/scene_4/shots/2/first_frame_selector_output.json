            "Reference establishing shot of location 'peasant_village_morning': A small, rustic European peasant village awakening in the early morning. The atmosphere is thick with low, cool mist clinging to the ground and obscuring views beyond a few yards. Architecture consists of extremely humble, single-story dwellings with thick, uneven thatched roofs and walls patched with wattle and daub or roughly hewn timber. The lanes are unpaved, churned earth and mud, glistening slightly in the weak, pale yellow sunlight attempting to break through the mist. Domestic animals like chickens and a few sheep graze nearby. Lighting is soft, diffused, and cool, characteristic of a foggy sunrise in a pastoral setting. The overall mood is humble and sleepy."

    "text_prompt": "Create an image following the given description: A photorealistic medieval fantasy medium tracking shot, using Panavision anamorphic lenses, capturing a young woman walking along a muddy path. The young woman MUST exactly replicate the facial features, hair, skin tone, build, and peasant attire from Image 4, specifically featuring her expression of open, unpolished laughter mixed with physical exertion, and carrying a heavy yoke on her shoulders. She should be framed slightly ahead of two older villagers who MUST also use the appearances (clothing, weathering) of the two older male villagers in Image 4. The immediate background must replicate the setting of Image 0: a small, rustic European peasant village awakening in the early morning, characterized by extremely humble dwellings with thatched roofs, unpaved, churned earth and mud lanes glistening slightly. The foreground elements like the muddy ruts and weathered wooden fences MUST reference Image 4. The lighting must be soft, diffused, and cool, characteristic of a foggy sunrise in a pastoral setting, matching the environment established in Image 0, but with the overall warm earthy tones described in the mandatory style. Use shallow depth of field with creamy anamorphic bokeh. Photorealistic medieval fantasy, HBO prestige television quality, shot on Arri Alexa 65 with Panavision anamorphic lenses. Natural skin with pores, imperfections, scars, freckles, and weathering. Deep chiaroscuro shadows, 35mm film grain texture. Ensure the characters look physically embedded in the space."
